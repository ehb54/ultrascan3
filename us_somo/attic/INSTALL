Installation instructions for UltraScan:

Installation Instructions - tar.gz package for any Unix distribution:

NOTE: Before installing ultrascan, please remove all old versions of UltraScan.

To install the tar.gz package for any distribution, please follow
these steps:

   1. After downloading the tar.gz package, you need to uncompress and
   extract it in a location of your choice, for example, /usr/lib or
   /usr/local or /usr/local/lib. For the purpose of this document, it
   is assumed to are going to install UltraScan in /usr/lib and /path
   is the path to your downloaded file.

cd /usr/lib 
gzip -d /path/ultrascan-version.tar.gz
tar -xvf /path/ultrascan-version.tar

   2. Next, you need to set a dynamic link from /usr/lib/ultrascan to the
   actual installation name:

ln -s /usr/lib/ultrascan-version /usr/lib/ultrascan

where "version" is the version number, for example: 

ln -s /usr/lib/ultrascan-7.0 /usr/lib/ultrascan


   3. Next, you need to set the following environment variables, either
   in the private login script file, or in a global login script file,
   or alternatively as shown in option (5):

      For sh, bash:

export ULTRASCAN=/usr/lib/ultrascan
export PATH=$PATH:$ULTRASCAN/bin

      For csh, tcsh:

setenv ULTRASCAN /usr/lib/ultrascan
setenv PATH ${PATH}:${ULTRASCAN}/bin

   4. Next, you will have to add the UltraScan library directory to
   your dynamically shared library list. If your Unix system supports
   dynamic link path configuration using /etc/ld.so.conf, this can be
   accomplished by adding /usr/lib/ultrascan to the /etc/ld.so.conf file
   and running ldconfig.

   5. If your Unix system does not support /etc/ld.so.conf dynamic
   link configurations, you will need to modify the "LD_LIBRARY_PATH"
   environment variable and add the UltraScan library directory to it:

      For sh, bash:

export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:/usr/lib/ultrascan/lib

      For csh, tcsh:

setenv LD_LIBRARY_PATH ${LD_LIBRARY_PATH}:/usr/lib/ultrascan/lib

   6. To verify that the environment variables are correctly installed,
   use the "echo" command:

echo $PATH
echo $ULTRASCAN
echo $LD_LIBRARY_PATH
or
ldconfig -v | grep ultrascan
