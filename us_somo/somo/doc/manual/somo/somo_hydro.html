In this module, various options controlling the computations of the hydrodynamic parameters for bead models can be set.
<p>The <i><b>Model units (-10 = Angstrom, -9 = nanometer)</b></i> field sets the scale units of the bead model being examined. Models derived from PDB structures are in Angstrom units, but the user might wish to compute the hydrodynamic
parameters for bead models coming from different sources, for instance from small angle solution scattering data, which might be in other units like nanometers. The field sets the exponential relating the units to meters (<b>default</b>:
-10).
<p>The <i>Solvent type and conditions:</i> box allows the definition of the solvent conditions to which the hydrodynamic computations are referred. The <b>default</b> conditions (Water @ 20 &deg;C) can be automatically set by selecting the <i>Set defaults</i> checkbox. Otherwise, enter a text description of the solvent in the <b><i>Solvent</i></b> field (<b>default</b>: Water) and its acronym (max 3 characters; <b>default</b>: w) in the <b><i>Solvent acronym</i></b> field. The temperature (&deg;C) can be set in the <b><i>Temperature (&deg;C):</i></b> field (<b>default</b>: 20 &deg;C), which will also affect the value of the partial specific volume <i>vbar</i>,
according to the equation:
<p> <i>vbar(T &deg;C)</i> = <i>vbar(ent)</i> + [4.25 x 10<sup>-4</sup> (<i>T</i> - <i>T(ent)</i>)]<p>
where <i>vbar(ent)</i> is either the <i>vbar</i> value calculated by the program at <i>T(ent)</i>=20 &deg;C, or the manually entered <i>vbar</i> with its associated <i>T(ent)</i>. See <a href=somo_misc.html> here</a> for how to control the <i>vbar</i> parameter. <br>
The solvent viscosity (in centipoises, cP) and solvent density (in g/ml) values should be then entered in the <b><i>Solvent viscosity (cP)</i></b> (<b>default</b>: 1.001940 cP) and <b><i>Solvent density (g/ml)</i></b> (<b>default</b>: 0.998234 g/ml) fields, respectively.<p>
To allow for more freedom in setting the solvent conditions, from the <span style="color:#CC0000">February 2021</span> release a new option is present: by selecting the checkbox "<i>Use manually entered solvent conditions regardless of temperature</i>", the values present in the "<b><i>T.C. Solvent viscosity [cP]:</i></b>" (<b>default:</b> 1.001940) and "<b><i>T.C. Solvent density [g/ml]:</i></b>" (<b>default:</b> 0.998234) will be used (T.C. stands for "Temperature Corrected", meaning that these values have been measured or calculated at a specific temperature).<br><p>

<span style="color:#CC0000">Note that these settings will be used by <b>all</b> the available computational methods, <b><i>SMI</i></b>, <b><i>ZENO</i></b>, and <b><i>GRPY</b></i> </span>.<p>

The other options will affect either all or just some of the available computational methods. The "<i>Computations Relative to (for SMI):</i>" box presents two alternative options that will be applied only to the <b><i>SMI</i></b> method, <i><b>Diffusion Center</b></i> and <i><b>Cartesian Origin</b></i>. The differences between the two are subtle, and are fully described in Garcia de la Torre and Bloomfield, Q. Rev. Biophys. 14:81-139, 1981 (<b>default</b>: <i>Diffusion Center</i>).<p>

The "<i>Boundary Conditions (for SMI):</i>" box also has two alternative options, valid only for <b><i>SMI</i></b>,
<i><b>Stick</b></i> (6&pi;&eta;<sub>0</sub>) or <i><b>Slip</b></i> (4&pi;&eta;<sub>0</sub>). For structures whose size is greater than the hypothetical solvent molecules, the <i><b>stick boundary conditions</b></i> apply. For the <b><i>SMI</i></b> method, the <i><b>slip boundary conditions</b></i> should perhaps be used only when the size of the entire molecule is comparable with the size of the solvent molecules (see Venable and Pastor, Biopolymers 27:1001-1014, 1988; Garcia de la Torre and Bloomfield, Q. Rev. Biophys. 14:81-139, 1981) (<b>default</b>: <i>stick</i>).<p>

The "<i>Total Mass of Model (for GRPY, SMI, ZENO):</i>" box, that applies to all methods, has two checkboxes allowing the user to select or override the <i><b>Automatic (Sum of Bead Masses)</b></i> computation of the mass of the model obtained by summing over the mass assigned to each bead. This can be done by selecting the <i><b>Manual</b></i> checkbox and entering a value in the <i>Enter mass</i> field. For normal operations on models generated by <b><i>US-SOMO</b></i> from PDB files, the <i><b>Automatic</b></i> option will do fine, <span style="color:#CC0000"><i>except</i></span> if a relevant number of non-coded or incomplete residues are skipped or are modeled with the <a href=somo_pdb_parsing.html><b>Automatic Bead Builder</b></a> (because then the total mass will be appreciably underestimated). If a <i><b>Manual</b></i> value is entered
in this field (and the <i><b>Automatic (Sum of Bead Masses)</b></i> checkbox is deselected), a message will be displayed in the progress window ("ATTENTION: MW = ....."). This should avoid the use of an incorrect external <i>total mass</i> value resulting by inadvertently leaving the <i><b>Manual</b></i> option selected from a previous model-generating session.
<br>Otherwise, the <i><b>Manual</b></i> option is mainly for analyzing models generated from external sources, for which the beads might not carry the mass information, and only the total mass is known. The total mass is necessary for the computation of the <i>Sedimentation Coefficient</i> and of the <i>Intrinsic Viscosity</i> (<b>default</b>: <i>Automatic (Sum of Bead Masses)</i>).<p>

The "<i>Inclusion of Buried Beads in Hydrodynamic Calculations (for SMI)</i>" box, valid <b>only</b> for the  <b><i>SMI</i></b> method, allows to either <i><b>Exclude</b></i> or <i><b>Include</b></i> the beads labeled as buried in the hydrodynamic computations by <b><i>SMI</i></b> for <i>SoMo models without overlaps</i>. We have demonstrated (Rai et al., Structure 13:723-734, 2005; Brookes et al., Eur. Biophys. J., 39:423-435, 2010) that for these models excluding the buried beads has no effect on the translational diffusion properties. Moreover, as the memory required by the full supermatrix inversion procedures implemented in the <b><i>SMI</i></b> hydrodynamics computations module grows exponentially with the number of beads employed, excluding the buried beads from the computations allows for both a faster processing and the capability of processing bigger structures (<b>default</b>: <i>Exclude</i>).<p>

The "<i>Inclusion of Buried Beads in Hydrodynamic Calculations (for GRPY)</i>" box, valid <b>only</b> for the  <b><i>GRPY</i></b> method, allows to either <i><b>Exclude</b></i> or <i><b>Include</b></i> the beads labeled as buried in the hydrodynamic computations by <i><b>GRPY</i></b>. As <i><b>GRPY</i></b> calculates the <i>rotational diffusion coefficients</i> and the <i>intrinsic viscosity</i> with a sound procedure, the effect of excluding a relevant portion of the beads, especially for atomic-sized beads such as in the <i>vdW</i> models, would need an in depth investigation. Preliminary tests (<span style="color:#CC0000">February 2021</span>,) indicate that reducing by &sim;50% the number of the used beads by using an ASA probe radius of 1 &Aring; and a cut-off of 1% of the bead theoretical surface area (see <a href=somo_asa.html>here</a>) has a &sim;+0.1% effect on the <i>translational diffusion coefficient</i>, a &sim;-0.13% on the <i>harmonic mean of the rotational relaxation time</i>, and a &sim;-0.22% on the <i>intrinsic viscosity</i> values for <i>vdW</i> models of lysozyme. However, excluding buries beads from the computations  allows for both a faster processing and the capability of processing bigger structures by the <b><i>GRPY</i></b> method. Due also to the availability of parallel <b><i>GRPY</i></b> for all operating systems from the <span style="color:#CC0000">July 2024</span> release, the <b><i>default</i></b> option is now to <i>exclude</i> the buried beads.<p>

Finally, the "<i>Overlap cut-off (for SMI):</i> box, valid <b>only</b> for the <b><i>SMI</i></b> method, allows the user to select a different bead overlap cut-off when checking the model before the hydrodynamic computations (it should be recalled that the <i>hydrodynamic interaction tensor</i> used by the <b><i>SMI</i></b> method is valid only for non-overlapping beads). If an overlap exceeding the threshold is found between any couple of beads, the computations are halted. An overlap cut-off is already present in the <b>Bead Overlap Reduction</b> set-up options, and if the bead model has been internally generated, then the <i><b>From Bead Model</b></i> checkbox should be selected. For models generated in other ways, the tolerance can be increased (at your own risk!) by selecting the <i><b>Manual</b></i> checkbox and entering a value in the <i>Enter cut-off</i> field. If this cut-off is different from the one present in the <b>Bead Overlap Reduction</b> module, a message alerting of the different cut-off value will appear in the progress window when the <b><i>SMI</i></b> hydrodynamic computations are started (<b>default</b>: <i>From Bead Model</i>).
