This pop-up panel will appear when the <b><i>Fit</i></b> button is pressed in the main <b>HPLC-SAXS</b> module. The panel shown above refers to operations with symmetrical, non-distorted Gaussians. If distorted Gaussians are used, the panel will contain additional fields/checkboxes, as shown below for the EMG+GMG function:<p>

<p>

The first three lines in the <b>Fit</b> panel control the centers, widths, and amplitudes of the Gaussians. For each of these parameters, it is possible to fix them to the initial values (<i>checkboxes</i> on the left side), or to allow a % variation (default: <b>5%</b>) from either the initial values (if the rightmost <i>checkboxes</i> are selected) or based on each cycle of iterations-generated values.<p>

Importantly, since for the most common situation of different aggregation states of similar species eluting from the HPLC column one can safely assume that each peak will present a similar distorsion, by default the <b><i>Fit</i></b> module will present one or two (depending on the type of distorted Gaussian function) extra checkboxes called <i>Common distorsion #</i>, already selected. They can be deselected to test the effect of allowing different distorsions for every Gaussian peak. Notice that when you have fixed gaussian(s) and you have <i>Common distortion</i> set, the distortions will only be common to the non-fixed curves.<p>

It is possible to also individually fix each Gaussian by selecting the corresponding <i>checkbox</i> on the <b><i>Fix Gaussians</i></b> line; the program will automatically present as many <i>checkboxes</i> as are the input Gaussians.<p>

The <b>Epsilon</b> field controls the step used in computing the discrete derivative, gradient or Jacobian.<p>

In the <b>Iterations</b> field the number of iterations/cycle is set (default: <b>100</b>). <p>

The <b>Maximum calls</b> controls the attempts to improve at each stage of the minimization.<p>

Several fitting algorithms are available through dedicated buttons: Levenberg-Marquardt (LM), Gradient Search Steepest Descent (GS-SD), Gradient Search Inverse Hessian (GS-IH), and Gradient Search Conjugate Gradient (GS-CG). When initially fitting a single chromatogram, normally a first iteration cycle is performed with the centers fixed, and then a second is sufficient with no constraint or with a restraint on the peak centers from initial values (default <b>5%</b>) to find a good set of Gaussians.<br>
The resulting Gaussians are updated in the graphics window, and their sum is shown as a dashed yellow line, so that the goodness of the fit can also be graphically assessed. The RMSD of the fit is also updated continuously in its main panel field.<p>

The <b><i>Restore to initial values</i></b> and <b><i>Undo</i></b> buttons are available to restart the fit procedure from the beginning, or to undo the last operation, respectively.<p>

<b><i>Close</i></b> will close the <b>Fit</b> window when a satisfactory fit is obtained<p>
