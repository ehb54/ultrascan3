SOMO - PDB Editor Module: Cut/Splice</h2>
<p>

<p>

In this module, functional, but with additional development planned,
provides the ability to cut and splice on individual chains of two PDB
files.  No fitting on differently labeled chains is currently
possible, although planned.  This program is tied to the PDB Editor's
main window, with <i>From</i> associated with the center editor panel and
the <i>To</i> associated with the right editor panel.  This can be
very useful, but can be a source of trouble if you are not aware
of the connection.  The PDB Editor is useful for selecting ranges
for the merging, fitting and cut-back regions.  Trial results can 
also be saved and visualized in the PDB Editor.  But if you load
or clear in the PDB Editor, it will clear the associated information
from the PDB Cut/Splice tool.

<p>
<b> Prerequesites </b> The residue numbers and chains must match.  Of
course, some can be missing, but the idea is that this program finds an
overlapping sequence of residue numbers in matching chains. There can
be multiple chains, but the fitting is done for each chain
independently.  From the user defined sequential range of the
overlapping sequence, of at least 3 residues, a fit is performed, and 
the <i>merge</i> sequence is transformed by the fit and added to the 
target structure. 
<p>
Only one end of an individual chain can be handled at a time.
i.e. if you want to add from a file to both the beginning and end of
a chain, you will have to run Cut/Splice two times.

<p>
<b> First </b> You must load a file using <i>Chains from</i>.  This is
the file from which you will be taking a sequence of residues to
merge.  Note: this PDB will automatically be loaded in the center panel
of the main PDB Editor window.


<p>
<b> Second </b> You must load a file using <i>Chains to</i>.  This is
the file to which you will be adding a sequence of residues. Note:
this PDB will automatically be loaded in the right panel of the main
PDB Editor window.

<p>
<b> Third </b> You must <i>Compute guess</i>.  If your PDBs are
compatible, the identified chains and ranges will be added to the top
area.  If not, recheck the <b> prerequisites</b>.

<p>
If all is well, at this point you should see one line for each chain
where the there are overlaps and values set for <i>Merge start</i> and
<i>Merge end</i>, <i>Fit start</i> and <i>Fit end</i>.  They may or
not be the values you want.  They may not even be valid values.  If
the chains nicely overlap, say <i>Chains from</i> has residues 1-52
and <i>Chains to</i> has residues 49-100 (notice the required minimal
overlap), then the program should figure this out and be all setup to
merge.

<p> In the image below, we have made separate PDBs out of
 residues 1-51 and 49-100 of an existing PDB.  Then followed
the procedures above to produce:

<hr>
<p>
<b><i>Chain</i></b>: 
This identifies a chain where a merge is possible.

<p>
<b><i>Merge start</i>, <i>Merge end</i> </b>: 
This is the sequence of residues from the <i>Chains from</i> PDB's
identified <i>chain</i> that will be merged into the <i>Chains to</i>
PDB's matching <i>chain</i>.

<p>
<b><i>Fit start</i>, <i>Fit end</i> </b>:
This is the sequence of residues from the <i>Chains from</i> PDB's
identified <i>chain</i> and the  <i>Chains to</i> PDB's matching <i>chain</i>
that will be used for coordinate transformations.  The program will compute
the transformation based on a best fit over this range.  Currently only
"CA" atoms are used in the transformation.

<p>
<b><i>Cut start</i>, <i>Cut end</i> </b>:
This is the sequence of residues from the <i>Chains to</i> PDB's
identified <i>chain</i> that will be cut off before any fitting
and merging.  This can be useful if there is more than the minimal
overlap available. 
<hr>

<p> 

<b> Validate </b>: If you have followed the steps above, then you are
ready to <b>Validate</b>.  This will recheck any adjustments you have
made to the values <i>Merge start</i>, <i>Merge end</i>,
<i>Fit start</i>, <i>Fit end</i>, <i>Cut start</i> and <i>Cut end</i>.
If everything is ok, the text area will show "Validation OK".  If not,
there is some issue with the settings, and you will receive messages
briefly describing the issue.

<p>
<b> Trial </b>: This will run the fitting procedure and produce the
output in the main PDB Editor window's right panel.  If you have a
multiple model NMR style <i>Chains to</i> PDB file, all models will be
processed.

<p>
<b> Start </b>: This will only be enabled if a <b>Target</b> has
been entered and the ranges are ready of <b>Trial</b>.  
If so, the <b>Target</b> file will be created. If you have a multiple
model NMR style <i>Chains to</i> PDB file, all models will be
processed.

<p>
<b> Stop </b>: For long running fitting procedures, you can
terminate by pressing this button.  This may be useful when
processing to a large multiple model PDB file. 

<hr>
<p>
<b> Clear </b>: This will clear the table.  

<p>
<b> Load </b>: This will load the table from a file.

<p>
<b> Save </b>: This save the table values to a file.

<p>
<b> Cut back </b>: This button will be enabled after <b>Validate</b> if it is determined that a cut back is possible.
Pressing the button will automatically compute the <i>Cut start</i> and <i>Cut end</i> values.  For example, suppose
you had an overlap of more than three residues on a chain.  Then you could adjust the <i>Merge end</i> value.
Then <b>Validate</b>, and the <b>Cut back</b> to automatically set the values.

<hr>
These are useful tools for interacting with the main PDB Editor window.  
The <b>From</b> is associated with the center panel, and the <b>To</b> is associated with the right panel.  Be careful,
changes made in the PDB editor effect the PDB cut/splice tool, so if you see something strange going on, it is likely
that you have done something in the PDB editor.
<p>
<b> From->Merge </b>: 
When you select a range of residues in the PDB Editor window's center
panel, this button is enabled to copy over the range values to the
<i>Merge</i> values.

<p>
<b> From->Fit </b>: 
When you select a range of residues in the PDB Editor window's center
panel, this button is enabled to copy over the range values to the
<i>Fit</i> values.

<p>
<b> To->Fit </b>: 
When you select a range of residues in the PDB Editor window's right
panel, this button is enabled to copy over the range values to the
<i>Fit</i> values.

<p>
<b> To->Cut </b>: 
When you select a range of residues in the PDB Editor window's right
panel, this button is enabled to copy over the range values to the
<i>Cut</i> values.
