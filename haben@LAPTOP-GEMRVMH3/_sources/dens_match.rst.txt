Density Matching experiments are used to determine the partial specific volume of colloidal particles by repeating the velocity experiment in a range of buffers with a different density, but identical chemical properties. Here it is important that the ionic strength and pH stay constant. This is most easily accomplished by using D2O (heavy water) which has mostly the same chemical properties as light water. The change in buoyancy incurred when changing the density of the solvent causes a change in sedimentation speed, which can be measured. The change is proportional to the density of the analyte. Density matching experiments exploit this difference.

It is recommended that users of this technique measure sedimentation velocity experiments in 4-6 different D2O concentrations, including one buffer that does not have any D2O in it (just light water). Finite element models from these experiments are imported into this program to elucidate the partial specific volume distribution for the entire solution mixture.
