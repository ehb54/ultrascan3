UltraScan vHW Distribution Plot
================================

In the van Holde - Weischet (vHW) Enhanced program, there is a Distribution Plot option that brings up a dialog in which the vHW analysis data is displayed as a distribution plot or a histogram plot. In either case, a clustering of data around several sedimentation coefficient points indicates the presence of multiple species in the solution.
