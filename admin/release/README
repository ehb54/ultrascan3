docker based release package creation


ubuntu:
./buildpkg.pl
read the notes displayed when running


to do -

qwt_version=6.1.6 is hard coded in the local.pri.somo so we need to change this & in the codeql container & workflow/codeql-analysis.yml

build dockerfile for redhat based releases (6?,7,8)
