# Formatting and Linting CMake Files

The `cmakelang` project provides Quality Assurance (QA) and other language tools for cmake:

- `cmake-annotate` can generate pretty HTML from your listfiles
- `cmake-format` can format your listfiles nicely so that they don’t look like crap.
- `cmake-lint` can check your listfiles for problems
- `ctest-to` can parse a ctest output tree and translate it into a more structured format (either JSON or XML).
