      C(s)Analysis:
    </h2>
    <p>
      The C(s) analysis [<a href=
      "http://www.biophysj.org/cgi/content/full/78/3/1606">P. Schuck (2000)
      Size distribution analysis of macromolecules by sedimentation velocity
      ultracentrifugation and Lamm equation modeling. Biophysical Journal
      78:1606-1619.</a>] can be used to generate sedimentation coefficient
      distributions from sedimentation velocity experiments. The principle of
      the method is based on finding non-zero terms in a linear combination
      of Lamm equation solutions describing the individual components in a
      sample. The coefficients of each term determine the partial
      concentration of each component. The method requires input of an upper
      and lower s-value boundary, an f/f0 frictional ratio, and a
      sedimentation coefficient resolution setting that determines the
      granularity of the linear combination. The frictional ratio is used to
      calculate a corresponding diffusion coefficient for each s-value term
      in the linear combination.
    </p>
    <p>
      The C(s) analysis can be started in one of two ways: First, you can
      launch the application by clicking on "<a href=
      "menu_velocity0.png">C(s) Analysis</a>" in the Velocity sub-menu of the
      main menu. The main <a href="cofs-1.png">C(s) analysis window</a> will
      appear. The second way to launch this application is from within the
      <a href="vhw-enhanced.html">enhanced van Holde - Weischet Analysis</a>.
      By using the van Holde - Weischet analysis, a model independent
      approach, a limit for the possible s-values present in the sample under
      investigation can be established before the C(s) analysis is performed.
      This eliminates the uncertainty introduced when the user selects these
      limits without prior knowledge, and it is therefore the preferred
      method to select the limits and to launch the application.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first step in the analysis requires that you load an
      <b><i>UltraScan</i></b> dataset that has previously been edited with
      the <b><i>UltraScan</i></b> editing module. <b><i>UltraScan</i></b>
      sedimentation velocity datasets always have the suffix ".us.v". Click
      on the "Load Dataset" button in the left upper corner of the control
      panel. Simply select the desired run from the selection of available
      runs in the <a href="load_sed.png">dataset loading dialog</a>. Once
      loaded, the <a href="run_details_veloc.png">Run Details</a> will be
      shown. Click on the <b>"Accept"</b> or <b>"Cancel"</b> button, and you
      will be returned to the <a href="cofs-2.png">analysis window</a>, which
      will show the first available dataset of the selected run in the edited
      data window on the lower right panel.
    </p>
    <p>
      Next, confirm the upper and lower limits for the s-value distribution
      range to be fitted to your data. If you launched the application from
      the enhanced van Holde - Weischet analysis, these values will already
      be set to a suggested value, otherwise, a default range between 1s -
      100s will be shown (which will not be appropriate for most
      applications). Also, a resolution setting needs to be selected. 20-50
      is an appropriate default for the first analysis. This can be refined
      in subsequent iterations. Finally, an f/f0 value has to be selected. An
      f/f0 value of 1 corresponds to a molecule with a perfectly spherical
      shape, the larger the value is, the more non-globular the simulated
      shape will be. If you are not sure of the appropriate value for f/f0,
      leave it at the default value of 1.5.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first iteration should be made with the "<b>Fit f/f0?</b>" value
      left unchecked by clicking on the "<b>Start Fit</b>" button. A single
      iteration will be fitted (which will be fast) and provide an initial
      view of the s-value distribution appropriate for the sample. During
      fitting, the "<b>Start Fit</b>" button will change text to "<b>Stop
      Fit</b>". Clicking on it at any time during the fit allows you to abort
      a currently active fit. After the iteration is completed, the upper
      plot panel will show now the <a href="cofs-3.png">residuals of the
      fit</a>. A <a href="cofs-resid.html">red/green residuals pixels map</a>
      is also shown in a separate window. Please refer to <a href=
      "cofs-resid.html">this link for more information on the residuals pixel
      map</a>. The <a href="cofs-4.png">C(s)distribution</a> can now be shown
      by clicking on the "<b>C(s) Distribution</b>" button in the upper left
      control panel. Once clicked on, the button will change text to show
      "<b>MW Distribution</b>". Clicking again, the fitted f/f0 value will be
      used to transform the C(s) distribution into a <a href=
      "cofs-5.png">molecular weight distribution</a>. At this point the
      button will change text again to show "<b>Residuals</b>". Repeatedly
      clicking this button will cycle through these three options.
    </p>
    <p>
      Continue to adjust the upper and lower limits until an acceptable range
      of s-values has been determined by performing single fits. Generally,
      such a range is found when the spacing of peaks is well distributed
      throughout the range and no end effects are visible (large amplitudes
      at the end points of the distribution).
    </p>
    <p>
      At this point one can fit for the most representative f/f0 value by
      selecting the f/f0 fitting checkbox. Clicking on the "<b>Start Fit</b>"
      button will then start a fitting session that tries to determine the
      optimal f/f0 value.
    </p>

      <a name="caveat1" id="caveat1"><font color="red"><b>Important Note:</b>
      The C(s) analysis can produce misleading results and artifactual peaks
      under certain conditions. If the f/f0 ratio is overestimated,
      additional artifactual peaks can occur.</font></a>

      CAVEAT:</b> For multi-component systems it is often unlikely that all
      species in the system have the same shape and hence the same f/f0
      value. Therefore the molecular weight distributions will often be
      skewed and not necessarily represent the true molecular weights in the
      system. The f/f0 value determined by this method is only a best
      <i>compromise</i> between all possible f/f0 values.</font></a>
