<p>
The html Report Generation Module is started from the "File" menu, under
"Generate Report". The purpose of this module is to automatically generate
a lab notebook of all experimental analyses and pertinent plots and files.
When selected, you have the option to generate a report for velocity analyses,
equilibrium data, equilibrium fitting projects, as well as Monte Carlo
analyses. Each function will produce two webpages. The first webpage will
have all plots, files, and ancillary information presented as hyperlinks,
the second page will present all relevant plots ready for printing. Each
page is cross-referenced at the bottom of the other page.
<p>
After the report has been generated, you are <a href=html_report-1.png>
asked</a> if you want to view the report. If you want to view the report,
your Netscape browser is automatically loaded with the linked page. All
files associated with any report will be placed into a subdirectory 
of the report directory, which is defined in the <a href=config.html>
configuration</a> menu. The subdirectory is generally the run ID or the
project name. For Monte Carlo analyses reports, the suffix ".mc" is added
to the project name.
<p>
If the report directory as defined in the configuration menu is below
the apache web server document root, the results can also be viewed 
on the Internet. Please follow the following guidelines when placing
your reports into a directory which is served from a webserver:
<p>
<ul>
<li>Webserver pages linked into user accounts are generally set up
below the directory "$HOME/public_html", where $HOME is your home account.
This directory is sometimes also called "www" or "html", check with your
system administrator for details.
<li>Please be aware that files served through the public webpages on your
server are accessible to anyone. If you want to lock your files with
password access, you need to set up a file called ".htaccess" in the root
of your report directory. More information on how to create password
protected directories is available on the <a href=http://httpd.apache.org/docs/>Apache documentation website</a>.
<li>It is always a good idea to check with your system administrator for
details of your webserver implementation and to first request permission
to place pages on your website.
</ul>
