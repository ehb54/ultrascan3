<H2>Second Moment Data Analysis:</H2>
<p>
The second momdent analysis will calculate weight-average sedimentation
coefficients for each scan included in the analysis by finding the second
moment point in the boundary. The second moment analysis can serve as a
valuable diagnostics tool in identifying problems such as time-dependent
degradation, aggregation and even concentration dependency. It is
important to keep in mind that the second moment analysis is only
valid for scans that have cleared the meniscus and still have a stable
plateau. All other scans should be excluded from the analysis.

<p>
You start the Second Moment data analysis by clicking on "<A
HREF="menu_velocity0.png">Second Moment</A>" in the Velocity sub-menu
of the main menu. The main <A HREF="sm1.png">Second Moment data analysis
window</A> will appear.

<p>The first step in the analysis requires that you load an <b><i>UltraScan</i></b>
dataset that has previously been edited with the <b><i>UltraScan</i></b>
editing module. <b><i>UltraScan</i></b> sedimentation velocity datasets 
always have the suffix
".us.v". Click on the "Load Dataset" button in the left upper corner of the
control panel. Simply select the desired run from the selection of available
runs in the <a href="load_sed.png">dataset loading dialog</a>. Once loaded,
the <a href=run_details_veloc.png>Run Details</a> will be shown. Click on the <b>"Accept"</b>
or <b>"Cancel"</b> button, and you will be returned to the <a href=sm2.png>
analysis window</a>, which will show the first available dataset of the selected run
in the
edited data window on the lower right panel, and the Second Moment analysis
will be shown in the upper right panel of the <a href=sm2.png>analysis window</a>.

<li>
<b>Data Smoothing:</b> Use this feature to smooth the experimental data.
For noisy data, increasing this parameter can improve the clarity and appearance
of the results considerably. Please note: Whenever possible, especially
for very steep boundaries with low diffusion, try to avoid using too much
smoothing to prevent artificial modification of the boundary shape. Smoothing
is performed based on a frame average. The number shown represents the
size of the smoothing kernel used (the number of datapoints averaged for
a single point). The algorithm used is non-destructive of the original
data and hence the smoothing is reversible. Also, point smoothing is independent,
where the smoothing of one point does not have any effect on the smoothing
of its neighbors. Only unsmoothened points are used for the calculation
of the smoothed value. Each time you click on the counter, the current dataset
will be reset to the full dataset.</li>

<li>
<b>% of Boundary:</b> This is the portion of the boundary used for the
analysis. 100 % refers to the entire boundary, reaching from the baseline
concentration value to the plateau concentration value. This portion is
shown in yellow in the experimental data plot at the lower right panel
of the van Holde - Weischet analysis window. Excluded data is shown in
blue. Changing this number will automatically reset the position of the
analyzable portion of the boundary in the center of concentration between
the baseline and the plateau concentration.

<li>
<b>Boundary Position (%):</b> For percent-boundary values less than
100 %, this number refers to the percentage of total concentration by which
the remainder (=un-analyzed portion of the boundary) is shifted away from
the baseline. A value of 0% refers to a data analysis start at the baseline.
This number is always less than or equal to 100 % - (% of Boundary). It
allows you to control the position of the analyzed portion relative to
the baseline. The blue colored portion of a scan is excluded from the analysis,
and the yellow portion is analyzed.</li>

<li>
<b>Exlude Single Scan:</b> When setting this counter to a non-zero value,
the respective scan will be highlighted in red. Clicking on "Excl. Single
Scan" while a scan is highlighted in red will delete this scan from the
analysis. Deleting scans from the analysis is irreversible and can only
be reset by clicking on the "Reset" button or by reloading the data (when
smoothing, the data is always automatically reloaded, causing the number
of scans to be reset to the original count). <a href=#skipped>Skipped
scans</a> are excluded automatically, because they haven't cleared
the meniscus.  This is equivalent to scans whose first point has an
absorbance larger than the baseline (as defined by the baseline absorbance
selected during editing). Second moment points for these scans will
be <a href=sm2.png>displayed in red</a> and excluded from the average,
which is displayed as a horizontal line in the second moment plot.

<li>
<b>Exclude Scan Range: </b>Same as "<b>Exclude Single Scan</b>", except
for multiple scans. To use this feature, select first the start scan
of the range by using "<b>Exclude Single Scan</b>", then complete the
scan range by using "<b>Exclude Scan Range</b>". Just like the van
Holde - Weischet analysis, the Second Moment analysis also requires
that scans have cleared the meniscus and contain a stable plateau in
order to be valid scans for inclusion in the analysis. Please see the <a
href="../tutorial/index.html"> van Holde - Weischet analysis tutorial</a>
to decide which scans are appropriate for analysis and which scans need
to be excluded.</li>

<li>
<b>Status: </b>The status bar informs the user about the progress of the
analysis. On slower computers this has more significance than on a fast
Unix machine.</li>

<p><b>Utility of Second Moment Analysis:</b>

<p>The Second Moment Analysis provides useful diagnostics to determine
certain properties of a velocity experiment. It will not, however, provide
information about the distribution of S-values present in the sample. The
van Holde - Weischet methods is better suited for this purpose. The strength
of this method is its ability to detect the following features:
<p>
<UL>
<li>
<A HREF="conc_dep1.png">Concentration dependent non-ideality</A> - A concentration
dependent sample starts out with a low second moment S-value and increases
as the concentration drops due to radial dilution. Eventually, it will
plateau at the true second moment S-value.

<li>Concentration dependent self-association - If you are looking at a 
self-associating system, such as a monomer-dimer equilibrium, the radial
dilution will shift the average S-value towards the monomer when radial
dilution reduces the concentration. This will most likely reduce the
average S-value over the course of the run.

<li>
Sample Degradation - A degrading sample will have a continuous decrease
of the second moment S-value throughout the run

<li>
Sample Pelleting - A sample exhibiting pelleting (loss of absorbance) will
also reduce the second moment S-value over time. The difference between
this condition and sample degradation is that pelleting samples will generally
not show a reduced second moment S-value until the later scans are reached.

<li>
Aggregation - A sample which aggregates over time, the second moment S-values
will increase towards the end of the run, with no plateau forming.
