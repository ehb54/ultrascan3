    <h2> <i>UltraScan</i> Density Matching:</h2>

    <p>
    Density Matching experiments are used to determine the partial specific
    volume of colloidal particles by repeating the velocity experiment in a 
    range of buffers with a different density, but identical chemical
    properties. Here it is important that the ionic strength and pH stay
    constant. This is most easily accomplished by using D2O (heavy water)
    which has mostly the same chemical properties as light water. The change
    in buoyancy incurred when changing the density of the solvent causes a
    change in sedimentation speed, which can be measured. The change is 
    proportional to the density of the analyte. Density matching experiments
    exploit this difference.
    </p> <p>
    It is recommended that users of this technique measure sedimentation
    velocity experiments in 4-6 different D2O concentrations, including one
    buffer that does not have any D2O in it (just light water). Finite
    element models from these experiments are imported into this program
    to elucidate the partial specific volume distribution for the entire
    solution mixture.
