<H2>Re-ordering Scan File Sequences:</H2>
<p>
<CENTER><img src="reorder1.png"></CENTER>

<p>
The Scanfile Re-ordering Utility can be loaded from the <a href=menu_utilities0.png>
Utility Menu</a> in the Main Menu section of <b><i>UltraScan</i></b>.
The reordering of scan files program allows you to fix corrupted 
archives of raw data files acquired with the Beckman Data Acquisition
software. On occasion, file collection fails for a file in the sequence
or one or more files end up missing for various reasons, creating "holes"
in the sequence. The <i><b>UltraScan</i></b> software expects all files 
to be in proper sequence, and this utility allows you to reorganize a
Beckman Data Acquisition data directory such that all files are in the
proper sequence expected by <i><b>UltraScan</i></b>.

</td>
<td>
<li><b>Absorbance Data/Interference Data:</b><br>
select the type of data to be re-ordered. Depending on the optical system 
selection, the file suffixes differ (interference = *.ip* and absorbance = 
*.ra*) and need to be dealt with separately.
<p>
<li><b>Select Directory:</b><br>
Select a directory containing the corrupted data. All scan files to be 
reordered need to be located in the same sub-directory. After selection of
the directory, the selected directory will be displayed in the directory panel
and all files residing in the selected directory will be checked for contents
and sequence. As soon as the file check has completed, all fields will be 
updated with the corresponding values for the files in the selected directory.
The default cell to be displayed will be the first cell in the sequence that
contains data. See "Cell selection box" for more information on how to display
information for a particular cell.
<p>
<li><b>Help:</b><br>
This Help file.

<tr>

</td>
<td>
<li><b>Total Cells:</b><br>
The number of cells contained in this run. It is expected that each directory
only contains a single run, i.e., all cells and scanfiles located in a selected
directory have to belong to the same experiment.
<p>
<li><b>Status:</b><br>
Displays the status of various file operations, such as file checking and 
sorting.
<p>
<li><b>Cell selection box:</b><br>
When the data directory is selected, all possible cell positions (1-8) are
examined for the presence of data. If data are found in a particular cell,
it will be displayed with "Cell x contains data", otherwise, it will be
listed as "Cell x is empty". Clicking on the desired cell will update all 
fields with the corresponding information for this cell.
<p>
<li><b>Message Box:</b><br>
The Message Box provides instructions to user about the steps required to
order cells as well as information about the status of the program and
properties of a selected cell. 
<p>
<li><b>Cell contents:</b><br>
This panel will show the contents of the selected cell as entered in the
Beckman Data Acquisition software.

<li><b>Check Wavelength(s):</b><br>
Clicking on this button will check for the presence of multiple wavelengths
(disabled for interference data) in the selected cell. All wavelengths that 
have been used to collect data in this cell will be listed here.<br>
<b>Note:</b> If the cell contains data collected at multiple wavelengths, this
program is not useful, <i>unless</i> the wavelengths are very close together
and were not selected to be different, but resulted from inaccurate
positioning of the diffraction grating. If absorbance data for different 
wavelengths were collected, the message window will display the following 
message:
<p>
<ul>
<i>This cell contains data which was measured at multiple wavelengths! 
It is not safe to re-order this cell!</i>
</ul>
<p>
If all scans were measured at the same wavelength, the following message 
will be displayed:
<p>
For in-sequence scans:
<ul>
<i>All scanfiles of this run are in the proper sequence. No reordering is 
necessary.</i>
</ul>
<p>
For out-of-sequence scans:
<ul>
<i>This cell was measured at a single wavelength. It is safe to re-order 
this cell.</i>
</ul>
<p>
<li><b>Wavelengths:</b><br>
After clicking on "Check Wavelength(s)", all wavelengths used to measure 
the selected cell are displayed here.
<p>
<li><b>Order this Cell:</b><br>
Re-order the scan file sequence for the selected cell.
<p>
<li><b>Order all Cells:</b><br>
Order the scan file sequence for all cells. The program will not check 
automatically if the cell was acquired at different wavelengths. The user
has to do that manually.
<p>
<li><b>Total Scans:</b><br>
The number of total scan files found for the selected cell is displayed here.
<p>
<li><b>First Scanfile:</b><br>
The first scanfile found for the selected cell is shown here. If the filename
doesn't display 00001.<suffix> here, scan files are missing in the beginning
of the run.
<p>
<li><b>Last Scanfile:</b><br>
The last file containing data found for the selected cell. If the number of
the prefix in the scan file name does not agree with the number shown in
total scans, the run contains out-of-sequence scan files and should be 
reordered.
