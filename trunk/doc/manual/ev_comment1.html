<h2>Information on Excluding Scans from Velocity Data:</h2>
<p>
Which scans should be excluded from a run depends on which analysis method
is used. Some whole boundary methods provide enough accuracy that even
data that has not cleared the meniscus or data that doesn't exhibit a stable
plateau can be included in the analysis. Methods for which this is true
include the finite-element method and some approximated solutions to the
Lamm equation that model the boundary conditions accurately enough
with error functions. For more information, see Demeler et al, Biophys.
J., 1998.

<p>Please note that you can still exclude scans later when you perform
an analysis that cannot accommodate scans too close to the meniscus or
without a stable plateau. Therefore, it may be better to leave all available
scans in the dataset at this point since they may be useful to increase
the fitting confidence for some boundary methods.
