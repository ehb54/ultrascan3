<H2>Multiwavelength Data Viewer for 2nd Generation Instrument</H2>
<p>
The Multiwavelength Data Viewer is used to import, display and export
ASCII and binary multiwavelength data from the second generation
multiwavelength optics developed at the Max Planck Institute for
Colloids and Interfaces in Golm, Germany, by Helmut C&ouml;lfen's group.
The viewer is started by clicking on <a href=edit.html>"<b>View/Edit
Multiwavelength Data</b>"</a> in the Edit sub-menu of the main menu,
<a href=viewmwl-0.png>loading up the viewer</a>.
<p>
<b>Process:</b>
<p>
<ol>

<b><li> Loading Data</b> First, you need to load experimental data. This
can be accomplished in one of two ways: 1. loading ASCII data as generated
by the ultracentrifuge, and 2. by loading a previously saved binary
representation of the data.  Simply select <b>"Load Binary Data"</b> or
<b>"Load ASCII Data"</b> before clicking on <b>"Load MWL Data"</b>. Before
loading, you also need to specify the cell and channel from which you
want to load data. This will reduce the number of files shown in the
file dialogue. After navigating to the data directory, you can select
multiple files for loading. While the data loads, the status bar and
the information label keep you posted about the progress of the loading.
Keep in mind that loading large data sets from ASCII formatted data is
very inefficient and may take a long time.

<p>Once data are loaded, the parameter controls will be reset to reflect
the data's properties, indicating limits for wavelength, radius and time.
You are now ready to process the data by various means.
<p>
<b><li> Saving Data to binary format:</b>
To save the data by making a binary copy, which loads much quicker
than the ASCII formatted representation. The information will be 
identical to the ASCII formatted version and can be reloaded by clicking
on <b>"Load Binary Data"</b> and <b>"Load MWL Data"</b>. <b>Note:</b>
Specify <b>"Intensity Mode"</b> or <b>"Absorbance Mode"</b> before saving
since this information is incorporated into the binary representation for
future data analysis.
<p>
<b><li> Exporting data:</b> Use this function to export the data to an
ASCII formatted representation compatible with the traditional XLA formatted
radial and wavelength files. Select the limits for wavelength, radius and
number of time points before clicking on <b>"Export ASCII"</b>. To export
wavelength data, select <b>"Plot Wavelength"</b>, to export radial data,
select <b>"Plot Radius"</b>.
<p>
<b><li> Movies:</b> You can display three different movies of the data. All movies
will only show the data specified by the limit counters for wavelength, radius
and time. You can crop any subset of data by changing the limits to the desired 
range. 
<p>
<ol>
<li> Viewing a radial scan and observing the change of the radial profile
over the wavelength domain: Select <b>"Plot Radius"</b>, <b>"2-Dimensions"</b>
and <b>"Movie"</b>.
<li> Viewing a wavelength scan and observing the change of the wavelength profile
over the radial domain: Select <b>"Plot Wavelength"</b>, <b>"2-Dimensions"</b>
and <b>"Movie"</b>.
<li> Viewing a movie of a 3-dimensional surface plot, showing the simultaneous
change of absorbance over the radial and wavelength domains.
Select <b>"3-Dimensions"</b> and <b>"Movie"</b>. To speed up the display of
movie slides it helps to reduce the number of wavelengths scans by averaging
multiple wavelengths into one. For acquisitions generated with the 2048 CCD
array, it helps to average 7-12 wavelength scans. Besides speeding up the display,
the image will also appear smoother because of the averaging. Depending on
the size of your display resolution may not be gained by not averaging any wavelength
scans because not enough pixels are dedicated to the screen to show all individual
points anyway, hence use of the averaging feature greatly enhances movie rendition.
<p>
<b><li> Saving movies to an mpg file:</b> All movie frames can be saved
to individual PNG image files by selecting <b>"Save Movie Frames to PNG
Images"</b>. The images are saved to separate directories to facilitate
processing image files later on. You will be prompted to either create
or select an existing directory for outputting the image files if you
select this option before the movie is shown.  A string of image files
can later be assembled into an mpeg movie. Under Linux, such a task can
be accomplished like this:

<p>
<b>
<pre>
<!png2yuv -j 3D-surface%05d.png -f 25 -I p -b 00001 -n 20 | mpeg2enc -o 3d-movie.m1v  !>
mogrify -format jpg *.png
mencoder mf://*.jpg -mf fps=10:type=jpg -o 3d-movie.mpg -ovc lavc -lavcopts vcodec=mpeg2video:vbitrate=1800
</pre>
</b>
<p>
This command will assemble a 3D-surface image sequence into an mpeg movie 
of original scale. The command will <!parse the first 20 input files starting
with image 3D-surface00001.png and ending with 3D-surface00020.png,> 
use a 10 fps frame rate for the movie, use no interlacing, and assemble the 
images into a movie file called "3d-movie.m1v".
<p>
For playback, use mplayer or xine. To slow the movie down, you can use:
<b>
<pre>
mplayer -fps 10 wavelength.mpg
</pre>
</b>
This would slow the movie down to 10 frames per second.
</ol>
<p>
<b><li> Printing plots:</b> All plots can be exported to either postscript or bitmap
image, 2-dimensional plots can be sent to the printer with the <b>"Print"</b>
function. 3-dimensional plots need to be exported to a postscript rendition before
being printed to a printer by commandline tools.
<p>
<b><li> Updating plots:</b> Clicking the function called
<b>"Update Plot"</b> will apply currently selected parameters
to either a <a href=viewmwl-2.png>2-dimensional radial plot</a>,
a <a href=viewmwl-3.png>2-dimensional wavelength plot</a>,or a <a
href=viewmwl-1.png>3-dimensional surface plot</a>. The 3-dimensional
data viewer from UltraScan is based on the 3D plotting library <a
href=http://qwtplot3d.sourceforge.net/>QWTPLOT3D</a> by Micha Bieber
and allows for detailed manipulation of the 3-dimensional image.

The binary/ASCII load descriptor control if binary or 
ASCII source data are loaded. Both contain the same information,
but binary data needs to be saved first. The next item selects what
information is displayed in the 2-D plots or processed in the movies.
The option is for 
wavelength vs. radius plots (<b>"Plot Wavelength</b>)are shown
or radius vs. wavelengths plots (<b>"Plot Radius</b>). The 
next item controls if updates or movies apply to a 2-dimensional
representation or a 3-dimensional representation. The data mode
(Intensity vs. Absorbance mode) determines the control flag 
written to the binary data (which is not contained in the ASCII data).
Clicking on <b>"Save Movie Frames to PNG Images"</b> allows you
to save all frames of a movie to individual PNG images.
