<h2>
SOMO - Overlap Reduction Options Module:</h2>
</center>
<P>
In this Module, you set the rules for removing the overlaps between the beads
generated in the first stage of the bead model building. This operation is
<b>mandatory</b> for a correct computation of the hydrodynamic properties of
the bead model because the hydrodynamic interaction tensor used is valid for
<b>non-overlapping</b> spheres of different radii (Garcia de la Torre and
Bloomfield, Q. Rev. Biophys. 14:81-139, 1981; Spotorno et al., Eur. J. Biophys.
25:373-384, 26:417, 1997).
<br>This operation is performed in three stages, treating first the <b>Exposed
side chain beads</b>, then the <b>Exposed main and side chain beads</b>, and
finally the <b>Buried beads</b>. The reason behind this procedure is to first
adjust the "surface" of the model, dominated by the exposed side-chains, then
complete it with the exposed main-chain segments, and finally adjust the buried
core of the molecule. Although the last operation can be in principle avoided if
the buried beads are excluded from the hydrodynamic computations, it is safer to
perform it because some beads initially classified as buried might become exposed
following overlap removal on the beads initially classified as exposed.
Common to all three Panels, The <i>Bead Overlap Tolerance</i> field sets the
limit (in the model's units) above which the difference between the radii of
two beads will classify them as overlapping (default: <b>0.001</b>).

The first checkbox in this panel, <b>Remove Overlaps</b>, dictates if the
whole procedure is active. It should be disallowed only for testing purposes
or if the model is <b>not</b> used for hydrodynamic computations (default:
<b>active</b>).
<br>The second checkbox, <b>Fuse Beads that overlap by more than:</b>, activates
a "fusion" process between beads that overlap by more than the threshold set in
the corresponding field (default: <b>70%</b>). This avoids the generation of very
small beads that would result from a simple reduction of their radii. A new bead
is created with a volume equal to the sum of the two original beads, and
positioned in the cog between the two beads. The fusion process is a hierarchical
procedure in which the couple with the biggest overlap exceeding the threshold is
treated first, and the ensemble is re-screened after each fusion (default: <b>
active</b>).
<br>Two alternative methods can then be selected to remove the remaining overlaps
not exceeding the fusion threshold: <b>Remove Overlaps synchronously</b> and
<b>Remove Overlaps hierarchically (larger -> smaller)</b>. An <i>Overlap
Reduction Step Size (in %)</i> field controls the finesse in this stage, by
setting the step size (in % of the involved radii) used to remove the overlaps
(default: <b>1%</b>).

In the <b>synchronous</b> procedure, the radii of all beads having an overlap
are reduced by the selected % value in each step, and the ensemble is then
re-screened; beads no longer having an overlap are dropped from the list. If the
<b>Outward Translation</b> checkbox is selected, the beads centers are also moved
outwardly by the same amount along a line connecting them  with the cog of the
molecule. The <b>synchronous</b>  procedure is potentially time-consuming and has
<b>not</b> been fully tested at this stage.
<br>In the <b>hierarchical procedure</b>, the biggest overlap between a couple
of beads is first removed by proportionally reducing their radii. If the
<b>Outward Translation</b> checkbox is selected, the beads centers are also moved
outwardly along a line connecting them with the cog of the molecule. The
minimal amount of translation and radius reduction leading to overlap removal
is computed by solving a set of equations. If the <b>Outward Translation</b> is
active, the whole set is re-screened for overlaps after each overlap is removed,
otherwise the couple is removed from the list and the next one is treated.
<br>The <b>Outward Translation</b> was devised to maintain as much as possible
the original surface of the molecule, which would otherwise shrink when the
overlaps are eliminated by reducing the beads' radii (default: <b>active</b>).

Overlaps involving <b>main-main</b> and <b>main-side</b> chain beads are now
treated. As in the previous Panel, the first checkbox in this panel, <b>Remove
Overlaps</b>, dictates if the whole procedure is active. It should be disallowed
only for testing purposes or if the model is <b>not</b> used for hydrodynamic
computations (default: <b>active</b>).
<br>The second checkbox, <b>Fuse Beads that overlap by more than:</b>, again
activates a "fusion" process between beads that overlap by more than the
threshold set in the corresponding field (default: <b>70%</b>). A detailed
explanation of this procedure can be found in the <b>Exposed side chain beads</b>
panel (default: <b>active</b>).
<br>Again, two alternative methods can then be selected to remove the remaining
overlaps not exceeding the fusion threshold: <b>Remove Overlaps synchronously</b>
and <b>Remove Overlaps hierarchically (larger -> smaller)</b>. The <i>Overlap
Reduction Step Size (in %)</i> field controls the finesse in this stage, by
setting the step size (in % of the involved radii) used to remove the overlaps
(default: <b>1%</b>).
No Outward Translation is available in this stage, because the only radii that
are reduced are those of the main-chain beads. If an overlap is present between
a side-chain bead and a main-chain bead, only the latter has its radius reduced,
keeping fixed its center. The two alternative procedures has been fully described
in the <b>Exposed Side Chain Beads</b> panel (default: <b>hierarchical</b>).

Finally, overlaps between all the beads initially classified as buried are
removed in this stage. As in the previous two Panels, the first checkbox in
this panel, <b>Remove Overlaps</b>, dictates if the whole procedure is active.
It should be disallowed only for testing purposes, or if the model is <b>not</b>
used for hydrodynamics (default: <b>active</b>).
<br>Only the two alternative options, <b>Remove Overlaps synchronously</b> and
<b>Remove Overlaps hierarchically (larger -> smaller)</b> are present in this
stage. They are ciontrolled by the <i>Overlaps Reduction Step Size (in %)</i>
field, and have been fully described in the <b>Exposed side chain beads</b>
Panel (default: <b>hierarchical</b>).
