<h2>Editing Interference Equilibrium Data:</h2>
<p> All experimental equilibrium data aquired on the XL-A requires substantial 
 editing and preliminary diagnostics before the data can be successfully analyzed
with various analysis methods. <b><i>UltraScan </i></b>assists you in this
process by handling most essential diagnostics and editing steps automatically,
but permits you to intervene, where necessary. Editing is started by selecting
<p>
<center><b>"Edit Equilibrium Data": "Interference Data"</b></center>
<p>
from the <A HREF="menu_edit2.png">main menu</A> of <b><I>UltraScan</I></b>.
This will bring up the <A HREF="edit_equil_i1.png">editing window </A>with the
plot area and the control panel.

<p>At the bottom of the control panel is a "Wizard" that provides step-by-step
instructions to guide you through the multi-step process of equilibrium
data editing. Refer to it to determine which action is required next.

<p><b>Step 1: </b>Select a data directory that contains the data files
acquired by the Beckman data acquisition program. Such a directory can
generally be found as a subdirectory of the Beckman data acquisition software.
The default installation for the Beckman software is C:\XLAWIN (under Windows).
Under Unix, the drive with Windows will generally be mounted under
the /dosc or /dos directory. You can always set the desired default location 
in the <a HREF="config.html">configuration panel</a> so you can avoid lengthy 
directory traversals to find the desired location quickly.
<p>
The experimental data will then be located in a subdirectory of the
form mmddyy/hhmmss (month/day/year/hour/min/sec), identifying the date
and time on which data acquisition commenced for a particular run. A <a HREF="edit2.png">file
dialog</a> will allow you to specify the desired directory. If the directory
contains files of the type 00001.ip1, 00002.ip1, ..., etc., then it is
a proper data directory. If the program cannot find enough scans in the 
selected directory, a <a href=edit3a.png>warning message</a>
will be printed on the screen.
<p>

<b>Note:</b><br>
Data directories retrieved from the database contain an additional file
called "db_info.dat" which contains database index information that is
automatically included in the edited data. The file is parsed during
editing and parameters such as run identification, celltype, centerpiece
type, rotor, buffer corrections, etc.  are included in the edited data
and later available during analysis.
<p>
Please note that UltraScan needs at least 3 scan files for each cell in order to 
identify the wavelengths used for the run.
Once
you have navigated through the directory tree to the desired data directory,
simply press the OK button. Next, the program will load the data in this
directory and determine a number of important diagnostics from the scan
files present in this directory:
<OL>
<li> The number and position of cells that were scanned in this
run. If not enough datapoints are found in the selected directory, a <a
href=edit3a.png>warning message</a> will be printed.  If the sequence of
the scan files is out of order, a <a href=edit3c.png>warning message</a>
will be shown. If this message shows up, you can rescue your data by
rebuilding the data sequence with the <a href=reorder.html>Scanfile
Reordering Utility</a>.

<li>
The number of scans that were taken for each cell

<li>
The average temperature over the entire run

<li>
The temperature of each individual scan

<li>
The program will determine if the temperature varied for more
than a pre-set tolerance value over the course of the run and
warn the user if the tolerance was exceeded. In such a case, a <A
HREF="edit3d.png">warning message</A> is printed forcing the user to
acknowledge the diagnostic before editing can resume. Depending on
the method of analysis of equilibrium runs, a temperature variation
during equilibrium experiments may actually be of little consequence,
since the software will compensate automatically for variations in
temperature-dependent density changes. When measuring thermodynamic
parameters such as association constants it is important to realize that
temperature variations may significantly affect the results and should
be avoided if possible.  Also, for velocity experiments a constant
temperature is required throughout the experiment in order to avoid
systematic errors introduced through density and viscosity changes,
as well as variations in the thermodynamic properties of the sample.

<li>
The length (duration) of the entire run in hours and minutes

<li>
The rotor speed at which each measurement was made

<li>
The identifications for each cell that were entered at the begin of the
run in the Beckman data acquisition program.
</OL>
The status bar will keep you informed about the progress of the diagnostics.
The length of time required to complete these diagnostics will depend on
the number of files in the directory that have to be analyzed. Once the
diagnostics are completed, the <A HREF="edit_equil_a2.png">diagnostics window</A>
will be displayed that shows the details of the selected run. The top panel
of the "Run Detail" Window will provide you with a profile of the temperature
variation over the course of the run. Shown is the temperature value of
each scan in the experiment. Ideally, the temperature should not vary more
than a few tenth of a degree over the course of the run. If the temperature
varies more than a pre-set tolerance value, the "Temperature Check" field
will show a red flashing LCD, otherwise a continuous green LCD. 
<p>
Clicking on the <b>"Time Plot"</b> button will present you with a
<a href=edit_equil_a3.png> plot of the time differences</a> between
scans. The <b>"Time Plot"</b> button will then change to a <b>"Speed
Plot"</b> button. Clicking on the <b>"Speed Plot"</b> button will then
show you a <a href=edit_equil_a4.png> plot of the speed</a> at which each
scan was recorded. Finally, you can recall the <a href=edit_equil_a2.png>
temperature plot</a> by clicking on the <b>"Temp. Plot"</b> button,
and cycle through the different plots by repeatedly clicking on the
same button.

<p>The purpose of this window is to facilitate the identification
of experiments from the rather cryptic information provided by the
file- and directory names created by the Beckman data acquisition
software. Information about various cells available for a particular run
can be obtained by selecting the appropriate cells in the listbox. In
interference experiments, you can collect scans from 8 separate cells,
because the counterbalance is not required after the radial calibration
has been made. <b><I>UltraScan</I></b> allows for up to 8 cells to
accommodate experiments performed with the 8-hole rotor AN-50 Ti,
and allows for an unlimited number of scans to be analyzed for each
dataset. The cell description will be updated for each cell that is
selected in the listbox. If the description for a particular cell was
not sufficient, it can now be updated and edited to accommodate changes.

<p>At the lower left corner of the diagnostics window you will find
a <A HREF="edit_equil_a5.png">list of speeds</A> for this run. If
you want to know how many scans and wavelengths were collected for a
particular speed, you can click on any of the speeds to obtain a <A
HREF="edit_equil_a6.png">window with the listing for that speed</A>.<b></b>

<p><b>Step 2:</b> Before editing of the data can proceed, a unique
run identification needs to be entered in the box labeled "Run
Identification".  This run identification should not contain any spaces
and should help the user in identifying the run by name. Spaces can be
replaced by underscores.  Please note that unlike under Microsoft Windows,
file names will follow Unix name conventions (case sensitive). For
example, a run identification such as "Chromatin_pH8" is distinct from
"chromatin_ph8". A practical way of naming runs is to use the logbook
number of the run, and to append a "v" for equilibrium-, or an "e"
for equilibrium runs. If the data was retrieved from the database, the 
run identification will be filled in automatically.
<p>
If you change your mind and do not want to edit this data, you can cancel
the editing process at this point by clicking on "Cancel" and you can then
select a different directory instead. However, if you do want to proceed,
click on "Accept". If you forgot to enter a unique run identification,
you will be reminded by an <A HREF="edit5.png">error message</A>.

<p>
<b>Step 3:</b> Make sure that the cell descriptions are correct and
adequate to identify the contents of each cell that contains data. If not,
you can now edit the description for each cell by modifying the string
in the editable text box.  After entering a unique run identification,
the window will close and you will return to the main editing window. The
<A HREF="edit6.png">control panel</A> will now show all fields updated
with the proper information obtained during the diagnostics. If the
data directory was retrieved from the database, the run identification
is automatically set and all cell and centerpiece parameters should
be automatically set to their proper values. Otherwise, adjust the
centerpiece, cell and rotor settings now.  Some data analysis methods
rely on the geometry information included in these definitions.

<p>The number of editable datasets will be displayed in the "Run Detail"
box. For interference data, a dataset is defined as the collection of
scans acquired for a single cell.  To load the first dataset for editing,
click on <A HREF="edit6.png">"Start Editing"</A>. All scans will then
load into the editing plot window, and the status bar indicates the
progress of data loading.

<p><b>Step 4:</b> After loading is completed, the data will be displayed
in the <A HREF="edit_equil_i7.png">editing window</A>. Review the settings
for rotor selection and centerpiece type, and adjust if needed.  If you
used a 6-channel centerpiece to collect your data, make sure to select the
6-channel centerpiece. Also verify that the rotor is correctly selected.

<p>
The selection of these items determines the method of editing as well as
the cell dimensions needed for integration of the modelled functions. If
the data was loaded from a directory that was retrieved from the database,
these settings should already be adjusted to their appropriate values.

<p>
In case the sample and reference channels were reversed during loading,
you can click on the "Invert Sign" button to flip the data back into
a standard display mode.
<p>

<p><b>Step 5:</b> Now you need to define the meniscus. In interference 
data this can be difficult, because the meniscus position is often not
very clear. Moreover, the meniscus position moves because of rotor stretching
at different speeds. Therefore, if you measure at multiple speeds (as
you should for a global equilibrium experiment), each scan will have
a different meniscus position. Since there is no reproducible feature
associated with an interference meniscus, <b><i>UltraScan</i></b>
cannot simply scan for a peak in the scanner trace as it is possible in
absorbance data. Instead, the user will have to define each meniscus
position manually. <b><i>UltraScan</i></b> can assist the user in
this process by zooming into each scan and channel and amplifying
the meniscus region for a better detection of the meniscus. To start,
find a <a href=edit_equil_i6.png>position a little to the left</a>
of the region where the menisci for all scans can be found (or for the
channel's menisci, if you are using a multi-channel centerpiece).

<p>
<b>Step 6 (optional):</b> Now the <a href=edit_equil_i5.png>wizard</a>
informs you that you can delete unwanted scans from the 
group of scans by using on the exclude buttons.
To exclude one or more scans, select the scan with the counter
and then click on
"Exclude Single Scan". To exclude a range of scans, click on "Exclude Scan
Range", after setting the scan number in the counter. ">>" and "&lt;&lt;"
buttons move in steps of 10, while ">" and "&lt;" move in single step
mode. To select a range of scans for exclusion, select the scan at the
beginning of the range with the counter of "Exclude Single Scan". Then
use the counter from the "Exclude Scan Range" button to define the last
scan of the range to be excluded.  As you select scans, the about to be
excluded scans will be <A HREF="edit_equil_i13.png">highlighted in red</A>. After
clicking on one of the "Exclude..." buttons, the highlighted scans will
be deleted from the dataset.
<p>
<b>Step 7 (optional):</b> If your data contains spikes or window scratches you
can edit them now. To edit a spike, click on the ">" - button until you reach the desired
scan. The selected scan will be highlighted </A>in magenta to assist you
in finding the appropriate scan (if you click on the ">>" and "&lt;&lt;"
buttons, you can move around in steps of 10, which may be useful if
you have a large number of scans in your dataset).  Once you found the
appropriate scan, click on "Edit Single Scan". This will bring up the
<a href=edit_spikes.html>scan editing dialogue</a>.
<p>
<b>Step 8:</b> Next, the right limit is chosen
for the useful data range for all scans in this cell or channel.
This range defines the data
used in the data analysis. Since the left limit has already been chosen 
through the definition of the left border of the meniscus range, now
you need to define the position at the bottom of the cell or channel
that defines the <a href="edit_equil_i12.png">right limit of the useful data</a>.

<p><b>Step 9:</b> Next, you will have to manually inspect the scan
to fine tune the meniscus position for each scan.  The data will be
<A HREF="edit_equil_i11.png">rescaled</A> to the new limits, and the
extraneous datapoints will be discarded. To better be able to find
the true meniscus position, you may maximize the window to enlarge the
plot. This is helpful on large displays only. Look for the meniscus where
there are sudden jumps of fringes near a smooth scan area. Click on <a
href="edit_equil_i10.png">that point</a>. Besides identifying the exact
meniscus position, this position will be used as the new left limit of
the useful data range. Repeat step 8 for each scan in this cell or channel.
<p>
<b>Step 10:</b>Once you have cycled through all scans of this cell
or channel, the program will automatically advance to the next cell
or channel, and you will have to repeat steps 4-9 for all cells and
channels.  When all datasets are edited, the program will return
with a <A HREF="edit20.png">message window</A> indicating that
all scans have been edited and the data has been written to a <A
HREF="file_format.html">binary file</A>.
