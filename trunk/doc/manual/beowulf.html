      Performing Monte Carlo analysis on nonlinear least squares fitting
      sessions is a CPU-intensive proposition, and such as a task is well
      suited for parallel execution. A Linux Beowulf Supercomputer is a
      cluster of Linux workstations, generally connected through a switched
      100baseT ethernet or gigabit network, which allows you to perform
      calculations in parallel, by distributing the calculation load over
      many processors.
    </p>
    <p>
      UltraScan is designed to take advantage of Beowulf-type supercomputers
      to assist in the speedup of Monte Carlo analysis. You can start the
      Beowulf module from the <a href="monte_carlo1.png">Monte Carlo control
      window</a>, by clicking on "Beowulf Control".
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Explanation of Buttons and Fields:</b>
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <b>Add Host:</b><br>
        Use this button to add a new host, which should be listed in the
        field to the right of the button, to the list of computing nodes used
        for the calculation of the Monte Carlo analysis. Not all available
        nodes have to be used, this way you can control the load on the
        Beowulf system by only specifying a subset of the available computing
        nodes. For multiprocessor nodes, you can specify multiple copies of
        the same hostname, which will cause UltraScan to issue the job
        multiple times on the host. You can double-click on any entry in the
        listbox to copy the name into the edit field.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Delete Host:</b><br>
        Delete the host in the edit field from the list of valid nodes.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Save Setup:</b><br>
        Save the currently defined list of Beowulf nodes in the file
        $ULTRASCAN/etc/hosts.beowulf
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Start Run:</b><br>
        Start a Beowulf Monte Carlo Run using the currently defined Beowulf
        hosts.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Merge Output Files</b><br>
        This function will merge all individual output files into a single
        file that can be read by the Monte Carlo analysis program. Each
        process operating on a remote or local node will receive an
        individual seed (an integer value) that assures that each process
        will randomize differently, so that individual processes do not
        replicate the same calculations. UltraScan will save the output of
        each individual process with the file name of the Monte Carlo output,
        plus the integer value of the seed, so they can be differentiated.
        The "Merge Output Files" function will merge all of these files into
        a single file.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Stop all MC Processes</b><br>
        This function will stop all currently running Monte Carlo processes
        on local or remote nodes to free up resources, if they become needed
        before the application terminates by itself based on the iteration
        setting in the Monte Carlo module.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Help:</b><br>
        Show this Help File.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Close:</b><br>
        Close the Beowulf Control Panel and exit.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Use ssh:</b><br>
        If checked, UltraScan will use the ssh remote shell program to start
        the job. Check the ssh manpage for detailed instructions on how to
        set up ssh/sshd. This is the preferred method if executing over an
        untrusted network, since all communication will be encrypted. ssh/ssd
        need to be configured to allow password-less connections for the user
        executing this program.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Use rsh:</b><br>
        If checked, UltraScan will use rsh/rlogin to start the job. This
        method doesn't require the installation of ssh/sshd, but should only
        be used on closed networks or networks properly secured by a
        firewall. Check your systems manual for configuration options of rsh.
        rsh needs to be configured to allow password-less connections for the
        user executing this program.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Use X-Display:</b><br>
        UltraScan will export the X-display to the host and display specified
        on this line as an environment variable for the program. Please note
        that the X-transport will not be encrypted, even if ssh is selected,
        but this is not a problem since no X-output will be generated anyway.
      </li>
    </ul>
