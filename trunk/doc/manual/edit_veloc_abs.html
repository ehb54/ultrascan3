<H2>Editing Absorbance Velocity Data:</H2>
<p>
All experimental velocity data aquired on the XL-A require substantial
editing and preliminary diagnostics before the data can be successfully
analyzed with various analysis methods. <b><I>UltraScan </I></b>assists
you in this process by handling most essential diagnostics and editing
steps automatically, but permits you to intervene, where necessary. Editing
is started by selecting
<p>
<CENTER><b>"Edit Velocity Data":"Absorbance Data"</b></CENTER>


<p>from the <A HREF="menu_edit1.png">main menu</A> of <b><I>UltraScan</I></b>.
This will bring up the <A HREF="edit1.png">editing window </A>with the
plot area and the control panel.

<p>At the bottom of the control panel is a "Wizard" that provides step-by-step
instructions to guide you through the multi-step process of velocity data
editing. Refer to it to determine which action is required next. Buttons are greyed
out (disabled) until their functionality becomes active, so only applicable
buttons can be clicked.

<p><b>Step 1: </b>Select a data directory that contains the data files
acquired by the Beckman data acquisition program. Such a directory can
generally be found as a subdirectory of the Beckman data acquisition software.
The default installation for the Beckman software is C:\XLAWIN (under Windows).
Under Unix, the drive with Windows will generally be mounted under
the /dosc or /dos directory. You can always set the desired default location 
in the <A HREF="config.html">configuration panel</A> so you can avoid lengthy 
directory traversals to find the desired location quickly.
<p>The experimental data will then be located in a subdirectory of the
form mmddyy/hhmmss (month/day/year/hour/min/sec), identifying the date
and time on which data acquisition commenced for a particular run. A <A HREF="edit2.png">file
dialog</A> will allow you to specify the desired directory. If the directory
contains files of the type 00001.ra1, 00002.ra1, ..., etc., then it is
a proper data directory. If the program cannot find enough scans in the 
selected directory, a <a href=edit3a.png>warning message</a>
will be printed on the screen.
<p>
<b>Note:</b><br>
Data directories retrieved from the database contain an additional file
called "db_info.dat" which contains database index information that is
automatically included in the edited data. The file is parsed during
editing and parameters such as run identification, celltype, centerpiece
type, rotor, buffer corrections, etc.  are included in the edited data
and later available during analysis.

<p>
Please note that UltraScan needs at least 3 scan files for each cell in order to
identify the wavelengths used for the run. Once
you have navigated through the directory tree to the desired data directory,
simply press the OK button (there is no need to highlight or individually
select scans in the directory, specifying the directory itself is sufficient).
Next, the program will load the data in this
directory and determine a number of important diagnostics from the scan
files present in this directory:
<p>
<OL>
<li> The number and position of cells that were scanned in this
run. If not enough datapoints are found in the selected directory,
a <a href=edit3a.png>warning message</a> will be printed.  If the
sequence of the scan files is out of order, a <a href=edit3c.png>warning
message</a> will be shown. If this message shows up, and you acquired
the data at a single wavelengths, you can rescue your data by rebuilding
the data sequence with the <a href=reorder.html>Scanfile Reordering
Utility</a>.

<li>
The number of wavelengths and their settings that each cell was scanned
with

<li>
The number of scans that were taken for each cell and each wavelength

<li>
The average temperature over the entire run

<li>
The program will determine if the temperature varied for more than a pre-set
tolerance value over the course of the run and warn the user if the tolerance
was exceeded. In this case, a <A HREF="edit3d.png">warning message</A>
is printed forcing the user to acknowledge the diagnostic before editing
can resume.

<li>
The time correction in minutes and seconds accounting for the rotor acceleration
period at the beginning of the run. Due to the near linear acceleration
of the XL-A, this number will typically be about half of the time it took
to reach final rotor speed. If you acquired your velocity data with an
older version of the Beckman data acquisition program that failed to
correctly record the times of the scans to file, you will get a  
<A HREF="edit3b.png">warning message</A>. In this case you may want to 
turn on the compensation switch in the <a href=config.html>
configuration panel</a>. This message can also be generated when there
were more than usual initial scans made at a low speed. In that case it is 
safe to ignore the warning, since the delay is real. (Loading equilibrium
data will often generate this message as well, of course, you shouldn't 
attempt to edit equilibrium data with this method.)



<li>
The length (duration) of the entire run in hours and minutes

<li>
The rotor speed at which the measurements were made

<li>
The identifications for each cell that were entered at the begin of the
run.
</OL>
<p>
The status bar will keep the user informed about the progress of the diagnostics.
The length of time required to complete these diagnostics will depend on
the number of files in the directory that have to be analyzed. Once the
diagnostics are completed, the <A HREF="edit4.png">diagnostics window</A>
will be displayed that shows the details of the selected run. The top panel
of the "Run Detail" Window will provide you with a profile of the temperature
variation over the course of the run. Shown is the temperature value of
each scan in the experiment. Ideally, the temperature should not vary more
that a few tenth of a degree over the course of the run. If the temperature
varies more than a pre-set tolerance value, the "Temperature Check" field
will show a red flashing LCD, otherwise a continuous green LCD.<p>

Clicking on the <b>"Time Plot"</b> button will present you with a <a href=edit4a.png>
plot of the time differences</a> between scans. The <b>"Time Plot"</b> button will
then change to a <b>"Speed Plot"</b> button. Clicking on the <b>"Speed Plot"</b> button
will then show you a <a href=edit4b.png> plot of the speed</a> at which each
scan was recorded. Finally, you can recall the <a href=edit4.png>
temperature plot</a> by clicking on the <b>"Temp. Plot"</b> button, and cycle 
through the different plots by repeatedly clicking on the same button.

<p>The purpose of this window is to facilitate the identification of experiments
from the rather cryptic information provided by the file- and directory
names created by the Beckman data acquisition software. Information about
various cells available for a particular run can be obtained by selecting
the appropriate cells in the listbox (<b><I>UltraScan</I></b> allows for
up to 8 cells to accommodate experiments performed with the 8-hole rotor
AN-50 Ti, and allows for an unlimited number of scans to be analyzed for
each dataset. The cell description will be updated for each cell that is
selected in the listbox. If the description for a particular cell was not
sufficient, it can now be updated and edited to accommodate changes. After
editing is complete, you can also edit the description of each cell with the
<a href=rename.html>Cell ID Editing Utility</a> for the edited data. 

<p><b>Step 2:</b> Before editing of the data can proceed, a unique run
identification needs to be entered in the box labeled "Run Identification".
This run identification should not contain any spaces and should help the
user in identifying the run by name. Spaces can be replaced by underscores.
Please note that unlike under Microsoft Windows, file names will follow
Unix name conventions (case sensitive). For example, a run identification
such as "Chromatin_pH8" is distinct from "chromatin_ph8". A practical way
of naming runs is to use the logbook number of the run, and to append a
"v" for velocity-, or an "e" for equilibrium runs. If the data was retrieved 
from the database, the run identification will be filled in automatically.

<p>If you change your mind and do not want to edit these data, you can cancel
the editing process at this point by clicking on "Cancel" and you can then
select a different directory instead. However, if you do want to proceed,
click on "Accept". If you forgot to enter a unique run identification,
you will be reminded by an <A HREF="edit5.png">error message</A>.
<p>
<b>Step 3:</b> Make sure that the cell descriptions are correct and
adequate to identify the contents of each cell that contains data. If not,
you can now edit the description for each cell by modifying the string
in the editable text box.  After entering a unique run identification,
the window will close and you will return to the main editing window. The
<A HREF="edit6.png">control panel</A> will now show all fields updated
with the proper information obtained during the diagnostics. If the
data directory was retrieved from the database, the run identification
is automatically set and all cell and centerpiece parameters should
be automatically set to their proper values. Otherwise, adjust the
centerpiece, cell and rotor settings now.  Some data analysis methods
rely on the geometry information included in these definitions.

<p>The number of editable datasets will be displayed in the "Run Detail"
box. A dataset is the collection of scans acquired for a particular wavelength
and a single cell. For example, if the cell in position 3 has been measured
at 260 nm, all scans measured at this wavelength for cell 3 are considered
to be a single dataset. To load the first dataset for editing, click on
the <A HREF="edit6.png"><b>"Start Editing"</b></A> button, which is now highlighted.
All scans will then load into the editing plot window, and the status
bar indicates the progress of data loading.

<p><b>Step 4:</b> After loading is completed, the data will be displayed
in the <A HREF="edit7.png">editing window</A>. Review the settings for rotor
selection and centerpiece type, and adjust if needed.
The selection of these items determines the method of 
editing as well as the cell dimensions for the finite element fit. If the 
data was loaded from a directory that was retrieved from the database,
these settings should already be adjusted to their appropriate values.
<p>
In case the sample and reference channels were reversed during loading, 
you can click on the "Invert Sign" button to flip the data back into
a standard display mode.
<p>
The first step in the editing of your data involves defining the
meniscus. Find a point to the <A HREF="edit8.png">left of the meniscus</A>
and click on it, then find a point to the <A HREF="edit9.png">right of
the meniscus</A>. After defining a point to the left of the meniscus, the
program will find the maximum absorbance between the two limits and define
it to be the meniscus. A small crosshair will be placed at that position
and the meniscus position will be <A HREF="edit10.png">marked</A>.
<br>
<br><b>Step 5:</b> The next step requires that the data limits are chosen.
Those are the limits between which the data contains useful information
for data analysis. This region should exclude the meniscus and the bottom
of the cell. First, the left limit is defined by dragging the mouse to
a position near the right of the meniscus, and then <A HREF="edit11.png">clicking</A>
on it.

<p><b>Step 6:</b> Next, the right limit is chosen in a similar fashion.
The data will be <A HREF="edit12.png">rescaled</A> to the new limits, and
the extraneous datapoints will be discarded.

<p><b>Step 7 (optional):</b> Now you will have the opportunity to 
edit scans that contain scratches, outliers or spikes in the data.
This is accomplished by selecting a single scan at a time with the 
"Edit Single Scan" button. The procedure is explained 
<a href=edit_spikes.html>here</a>. 

<p><b>Step 8 (optional):</b> Next, you may want to exclude one or
more scans from the run. While not <A HREF="ev_comment1.html">strictly
necessary</A> at this point, you can exclude a single scan by clicking on
"Exclude Single Scan" or a range of scans by clicking on "Exclude Scan
Range", after setting the scan number in the counter. ">>" and "&lt;&lt;"
buttons move in steps of 10, while ">" and "&lt;" move in single step
mode. To select a range of scans for exclusion, select the scan at the
beginning of the range with the counter of "Exclude Single Scan". Then
use the counter from the "Exclude Scan Range" button to define the
last scan of the range to be excluded.  As you select scans, the
about to be excluded scans will be <A HREF="edit17.png">highlighted
in red</A>. After clicking on one of the "Exclude..." buttons, the
highlighted scans will be deleted from the dataset. Please also refer to
the <a href=../tutorial/index.html> van Holde - Weischet tutorial's</a>
section on <a href=../tutorial/editing.html> data editing</a>.

<p><b>Step 9:</b> Now you have to define a plateau absorbance for all
scans by clicking with the mouse at the <A HREF="edit18.png">appropriate
point</A> in the cell. Simply pick at a point that defines a stable
plateau for <I>most</I> of the scans in the plot. Even if some scans
clearly do not meet the criteria of a stable plateau, certain methods
will give the appropriate diagnostics (van Holde - Weischet method) and
allow you to exclude those scans from the analysis, while other methods
(finite-element and other whole boundary fitting methods) can incorporate
those scans without a stable plateau into the analysis. After clicking,
the program will average a few points to the left and to the right of the
point you clicked to arrive at a value for the plateau absorbance of each
scan.  Please also refer to the <a href=../tutorial/index.html> van Holde
- Weischet tutorial's</a> section on <a href=../tutorial/editing.html>
data editing</a>.


<p><b>Step 10:</b> The last step in the analysis is the definition for
the baseline. After defining the plateau absorbances for each scan, the
last scan will be <A HREF="edit19.png">displayed</A>, because it will have
the most pronounced baseline. Find a point at which the baseline
absorbance is constant and click on it. The program will average a
few points to the left and to the right of the point you clicked to arrive
at a value for the baseline absorbance.
<p>
Now the data for the first dataset is edited and the program will
automatically cycle to the next dataset by returning to the main
editing window and updating the progress bar to indicate the status
of file loading. Repeat <b>Steps 4 - 10 </b>for all datasets in
the run. When all datasets are edited, the program will return
with a <A HREF="edit20.png">message window</A> indicating that
all scans have been edited and the data has been written to a <A
HREF="file_format.html">binary file</A>.
