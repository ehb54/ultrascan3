    <h2> <i>UltraScan</i> Fit Controls for 2DSA: </h2>

    <p> The parameters of this dialog define and control an analysis run
    to find the set of solutes that best fits experimental data.

    <p> Each refinement iteration proceeds over a defined grid of s and f/f0
    values. That grid is divided into subgrids as defined by a number of
    grid refinements in each direction. The base fit analysis pass thus
    defined may be repeated a specified number of times, with the second
    and subsequent refinement iterations adding calculated solutes from the
    previous iteration to subgrid solutes in each subgrid analysis.</p>

    <p> A full set of analysis iterations may be repeated for either a range
    of meniscus points or a number of monte carlo iterations.</p>

    <h3> Process:</h3>

    <ul>
       <li>
          <b>Define the Grids:</b> First, define the overall solute grid
          with Fitting Controls giving an s and f/f0 range; and divide that
          total grid into subgrids using Grid Refinements.
       </li>
          
       <li>
          <b>Set Refinement Iterations:</b> Secondly, set a value for
          Maximum Iterations of refinement passes.
       </li>
          
       <li>
          <b>Set any Meniscus/Monti Carlo:</b> Thirdly, if desired, set
          parameters defining a Meniscus scan or set of Monte Carlo iterations.
       </li>
          
       <li>
          <b>Set Threads:</b> Next, after control values are set, define
          a number of threads that is appropriate to the complexity of the run
          and the number of processors or cores available on your machine.
       </li>
          
       <li>
          <b>Start the Fit:</b> Begin the fit analysis by clicking
          "Start Fit".
       </li>
          
       <li>
          <b>Display and Save Results:</b> After simulation, a variety of
          options are available for displaying simulation results, residuals,
          and distributions. Report text files and graphics plot files can
          also be generated.
       </li>
    </ul>

          machine's total processors or cores.

          <b>Grid Refinements:</b> The number of refinements (subgrid points)

          data input the previous iteration's simulated data with gaussian
          determined random variations. Note that as mentioned above, this
          choice and Meniscus are mutually exclusive. Monte Carlo iterations
