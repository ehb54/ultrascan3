      Archive Manager Utility:
    </h2>

    <p>
      The Archive Manager utility can be invoked by clicking on the <a href=
      "menu_utilities0.png">"Archive Manager"</a> entry in the Utility Menu
      from the Main Menu of <b><i>UltraScan</i></b> (<b>Note:</b> The archive
      utility is not available on all platforms). The purpose of this module
      is to provide a simple interface to managing large number of related
      data files in big analysis projects by providing an archiving utility
      that allows you to group files together in a single compressed data
      archive. These single files are then easily transferred to a different
      computer and maintain complete portability across different
      workstations. As a side benefit, disk usage is reduced.
    </p>
    <p>
      The user also may want to archive data on CDROM, and this utility
      allows you to generate single-file data archives for inclusion into
      CDROM archives.

        <td>
          Load an existing archive from the archive directory (see <a href=
          "config.html">Ultrascan Configuration</a> for details) and view the
          contents. There can be up to three sub-archives in each main
          archive representing different groups of related data files (see
          Archive Creation, below). When viewing an archive, all available
          sub-archives will be shown in the report window, as will be the
          filename, the size of the archive, the compression ratio and the
          amount of diskspace needed to extract the archive. The program will
          also compute the amount of diskspace available to the user on the
          filesystem that has been configured for the export of the data. It
          is assumed that the data will be restored to the same filesystem as
          the configured data directory. If the available diskspace is not
          sufficient for extraction, a warning message will be printed and
          the user will be alerted to free up some diskspace before
          proceeding to extract the archive.

          If selected, edited data stored in the UltraScan Results directory
          will be included in the archive. This data may not be always
          portable across different architectures, since different hardware
          address binary data in different ways. All other files archived
          will always be portable, even across different hardware
          architectures. In the worst case, you will have to re-edit and
          re-analyze the experimental data if unpacked on a different
          architecture. This button is selected by default. Raw experimental
          data will always be added to an archive, regardless of settings.

          If selected, the archive manager will archive html reports, if

          This option is selected by default, and this data will be added to
          the archive in addition to UltraScan data, if selected and the raw
          experimental data, which will always be added to the archive by
          default.

        <td>
          If selected, the archive manager will delete all source files after
          creation of the archive in order to conserve diskspace. This
          includes the deletion of original raw experimental data files,
          which will always be added to the archive by default. This button

          speed, the compression of the archive may take several minutes.
