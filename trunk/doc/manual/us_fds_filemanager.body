    <h2> <i>UltraScan</i> Fluorescence Data File Manager: </h2>

    <p> This module allows the user to manage scan files created by the
    AOS Fluorescence Detector data acquisition software. The AOS data
    acquisition software outputs scan files with a range of different
    naming conventions to accommodate different cells, channels, and
    importantly, different gain or voltage settings. When experimental
    data are acquired with a singe gain setting, the output files are
    names A00001.FI1, A00001.FI2, ... for channel A, and B00001.FI1,
    B00001.FI2, ... for channel B. When multiple gain settings are used to
    scan the data, a prefix (1_A00001.FI1, 2_A00001.FI1, ...) is added,
    incrementing the number of the prefix by one for each gain setting.
    This procedure allows the user to distinguish between scans for
    different gain settings, but this requires renaming so that a run
    can be imported into the OpenAUC format. UltraScan-III recognizes
    only scan filenames without the prefix. This module allows the
    user to select files with gainsets, speeds, and subsets of scans
    that are supposed to be combined into a logical run, or experiment.
    Depending on the experiment performed, it may be necessary to combine
    different gains from different speeds into a single run (for example,
    for equilibrium experiments, where different gains may need to be
    used to measure different gradients evolving at different speeds,
    where low speeds produce shallow gradients (requiring a higher gain
    setting) and higher speeds form steeper gradients that may require a
    lower gainset for optimal dynamic range). The program allows the user
    to export all selected triples, speeds, gain settings and scans to a
    new directory, where the selected scans are saved with the standard
    file naming convention used for single gain settings.
    </p>
    <p> The program can also be used to merge scan files from arbitrary many
    directories into a single directory to create a combined run directory
    suitable for a single data import action in UltraScan-III.

    <p>The input to this module consists of fluorescence data only,
    scan files from other optical systems are ignored.  
    </p>

    <h3> Process:</h3>

    <ul>
       <li>
          <b>Load Data:</b> Load fluorescence data by clicking on "Load
          Data" <br /> A file manager dialog will be shown that allows you
          to navigate to the directory containing the desired fluorescence
          data. You do not need to select any files at this stage, only
          the directory that contains all the desired scans. Only one
          directory can be chosen at this stage. Once loaded, the "Dataset Info"
          field will indicate a summary of the number scans in this directory,
          the number of triples, speeds and gain settings for this directory.
          All scans for the first triple, speed and gain setting will be plotted
          in the graph window:
          <p/>

          <p>
          Once loaded, the listboxes will be populated with all triples, speeds and 
          gain settings. The gain settings will be listed if they differ by 
          voltage, gain set or range:
          <p/>

          <img src="images/us_fds_filemanager-2.png" alt="FDS File Manager Main Window"/>

          <p>
          <b>Tip:</b> If everal triples, speeds or gain settings are
          listed, a quick review is possible by simply clicking with
          the mouse on any listbox item and scrolling through the list
          by holding down an arrow key button.
          </p>

       </li>

       <li>
          <b>File Exclusion:</b> There are multiple ways to exclude files
          before sorting all files into a single directory. For example,
          if the channel leaked, or the data are unusable for some other
          reason, "Delete Triple" will remove the entire triple from the
          list. Alternatively, a scan file selection allows the user to
          save a subset of scans. Scans marked for exclusion will be marked
          in red, all others in yellow. To perform the exclusion, click on
          "Delete marked Scan(s)":
          <p/>

          <p>
	  Additional convenience functions are available to quickly
	  delete a subset of scans. "Delete all Scans" will remove all
	  scans for the active triple, speed, and gain setting selection,
	  but not other scans from this triple. To save only the first
	  scan of a selection, click on "Save first Scan". The first scan
	  may be needed for cases where the meniscus has to be determined
	  visually. Similarly, "Save last Scan" will only save the last
	  scan of the selection shown on the screen. This is useful for
	  picking the last scan in an equilibrium experiment, which is
	  presumably closest to equilibrium. "Save first and last Scan"
	  will save both:

       </li>

       <li>
          <p>
          <b>Exporting selected Files:</b> Once all scans that are not
          desired have been marked for deletion, the remaining scans
          can be reviewed by selecting the desired triple, speed and
          gain setting, and then be exported by clicking on "Export File
          Selection". A new target directory should be created where the
          file selection can be written with sorted filenames suitable
          for import into US3. All exported files will be written with
          standard filenames of the format <i>A00001.FI1, A00002.FI1,
          ...</i>.  
          </p>

       </li>

       <li>
          <p>
          <b>Merging Files from multiple directories:</b> To combine
          files from different directories (for example, different
          speeds from an equilibrium experiment that was collected with
          multiple methods), you can use the following procedure: First,
          load the data from the directory that contains the earliest
          experimental data. Process all files as needed using the
          scan exclusion routine shown above, keeping only the desired
          scans. Select a prefix for this experiment where the magnitude
          of the prefix number corresponds to the time of the experimental
          dataset. Files will later be sorted based on the filename, with
          files containing prefix "1_" sorted before files with prefix
          "2_", and so forth. If you have more than 10 different files,
          you need to start with a prefix "10_" or larger, because "10_"
          is sorted before "2_". Accumulate all runs into a single, newly
          created directory. Once merging all files into this directory,
          use this module once more to convert and merge all files with prefixes 
          into a single new directory without prefixes. The second newly 
          created directory will then contain the merged files suitable for
          import into UltraScan-III.
          </p>
