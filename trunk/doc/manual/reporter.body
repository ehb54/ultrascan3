    <h2> <i>UltraScan</i> Report Generator: </h2>

    <p> This module is launched from the US main window using the
    Utilities > Report Generator menu item. It enables the user to create and
    view a composite report generated from selections of individual analysis
    program reports and plots.</p>

    <p> Upon launch, selection of a Run (or "all" runs) populates a data tree
    with reports from which to select the components of the composite report.
    A click on the "View" or the "Save" button generates the report, which can
    be viewed in a browser and printed. Both the composite report HTML and all
    the component reports and plots are copied to a new folder so that the
    page is fully self-contained, can be archived, and can be viewed in the
    future.</p>

       <li>
          <b>(data tree selections)</b> Select reports and plots for the
          composite by checking the box to the left of an item. A check or
          uncheck of an item above the final (report/plot) tree level selects
          or de-selects all lower-level items. A check box with a shaded mark
          indicates that some (not all) of the item's descendant items have
          been selected. Click on the "+" or "-" boxes to expand or collapse
          tree portions.
