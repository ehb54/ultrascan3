      This program enables you to combine multiple diffusion coefficient
      distributions from the C(s) analysis into a single plot. You can
      combine multiple datasets (either from different cells of the same run
      or from different runs) by using the "Combine C(D) Distributions" item
      from the <a href="menu_utilities0.png">Utilities</a> menu. This will
      allow you to compare molecular weight distributions (which are derived
      from integral distributions) from different runs and different cells to
      each other. This may be useful if you analyzed the same sample under
      different conditions, for example, different pH levels or different
      concentrations. If the samples are the same, the distributions should
      overlay, if the samples behave differently, the distributions will be
      shifted against each other.
    </p>
    <p>
      <font color="red"><b>Important Note:</b> The diffusion coefficient
      distribution is based on a single f/f0 value either set or fitted in
      the C(s) analysis, and on a single vbar value identified with this run.
      If either the vbar or the f/f0 value is incorrect, the diffusion
      coefficient distribution will also be incorrect. In general, it is
      unlikely that multiple components in a single experiment will have the
      same f/f0 value. This unlikelyhood is translated into the reliability
      of the diffusion coefficient distribution. If only a single component
      is visible in the distribution it is more likely that the value
      determined for f/f0 is correct.</font>
    </p>
    <p>
      You can remove erroneously added distributions by double clicking on
      the distribution to remove it. The curve will be highlighted in
      <a href="combine_cofd2.png">white</a> and a <a href=
      "combine7.png">message window</a> will ask you if you want to delete
      it. Confirm or cancel.

              <b>Load Data:</b> Load edited data sets (with the *.us suffix).
              A <a href="load_sed.png">file dialogue</a> will allow you to
              select a previously edited and saved velocity experiment. If
              the data was edited with a version of UltraScan less than the
              current version, an <a href="version.png">error message</a>
              will be displayed.

              <b>Save Data:</b> Write out a copy of all distributiones to an
              ASCII formatted data file suitable for import into a
              spreadsheet plotting program. The data will be saved in a file
              called "cofd_distrib.dat" in your results directory (see
              <a href="config.html">configuration panel</a>). See "<a href=
              "file_format.html">File Structures and Formats</a>" for
              details. The descriptions in the legend for each dataset is
              saved in an ASCII file called "cofd_distrib.txt". Note: These
              files are overwritten each time this button is clicked. Only
              the last version of the analysis will be saved! You can
              associate the distribution file by giving it the same name as
              the run to whose report you would like to add the distribution
              information. Then the data will be saved in the report
              directory with the name of the run. This way you can avoid
              overwriting distribution files.

          Single-clicking on a cell or wavelength will bring up the sample
          description of that cell and wavelength. If no data is available
          for your selection, it will be indicated in the top field.
          Double-clicking on a valid selection will add the integral
          distribution of that selection to the plot area and add an item to
          the legend. Scroll through this list to bring up information for
          cells &gt; 3. If you double-click on an invalid item, an <a href=
          "combine8.png">error message window</a> will appear. If the
          selection is valid, but a distribution plot has not been saved from
          the van Holde - Weischet analysis, an <a href="combine9.png">error
          message</a> will appear.

            If you decide to eliminate a distribution plot from the combined

            and you will be asked if you want to delete the highlighted scan.
            The scan about to be deleted will be highlighted in white.

          Sometimes the legend does not appear correctly resized (for
          example, if the item in the description of the sample is too long
          for the provided screen area), In that case, it is necessary to
          resize the window to a larger size to accommodate the longer text.
          Click on "<a href="combine10.png">Zoom in</a>" or "<a href=
          "combine11.png">Zoom out</a>" to present a smaller or larger scale
          of the item. Clicking on the X-min and X-max counters allows you to
          manually set the X-min/max limits of the data plot.
