Protein Extinction Profile Calculation:</h2>
</center>

<center><img SRC="global_lambda1.png"></center>


<p>
Oftentimes you may know the extinction coefficient of a protein at 280
nm from previous measurements or based on an estimate from the protein
sequence by the method of Gill and von Hippel. However, estimating the 
extinction coefficients at different wavelengths involves cumbersome
absorbance measurements and calculations, which have to be repeated for
each individual wavelength.
<p>
A simple approach to determine the extinction coefficients of a protein
at wavelenghts different from 280 is to measure the absorbance of the 
protein over a larger wavelength range at multiple concentrations and 
then fit the data globally to a "best-fit" extinction function that describes
the protein's extinction properties at each wavelength.
The approach chosen in this module is to measure the absorbance profile of a 
protein at several different concentrations over the wavelength range
of interest, which can easily be accomplished with the XLA. The resulting 
wavelength scans are then fit to a global extinction profile
using sums of Gaussians, which are weighted by multipliers, representing
the concentration of the sample in each scan.
<p>
The need for this capability becomes apparent when one analyzes 
self-associating systems with the equilibrium technique. In such cases
it is advantageous to examine the sample over a large concentration range
in order to obtain signal from all species present. This often requires
measurements at different wavelengths (typically 208-212 nm, 230 nm, 
278 nm and 280 nm), where the protein exhibit different extinction 
properties. On occasion, proteins contain chromophores in the 
visible range (i.e., heme-containing proteins), which could also be 
utilized.
<p>
The program will crop valid data (within reasonable absorption limits,
generally 0.0 - 0.9 OD) from each wavelength scan and fit it with a global
fitting function composed of sums of Gaussian distributions with different 
amplitudes, peak positions and peak widths. The global function is then
multiplied with a floating scalar which represents the concentration of the
scan's sample.
<p>
Once a suitable fitting function has been found, a common extinction
profile is extracted and normalized with a single, known wavelength
extinction coefficient, typically estimated from sequence at 280 nm
by the method of Gill and von Hippel (Anal. Biochem. 182:319-326, 1989).
The pathlength of the sample cell can also be taken into account.
<p>
A summation of Gaussian terms is a natural choice for the extincion 
function, since it should represent the absorbance peaks of the protein. In
most cases it is sufficient to fit the data at hand to a sum of 4-5 
Gaussians, determining in each case the value of the position, width and
amplitude of each Gaussian peak by nonlinear least squares estimation.
<p>
Multiple wavelength scans of the same protein at different concentration
will highlight different absorbance peaks and, when fitted globally, will
generate a unique function describing the absorption/extinction properties
of the protein.
<p>
<b>Experimental Design:</b>
<p>
The nonlinear least squared global fitting of wavelength scans to a unique
extinction profile requires a prudent choice for scans at the correct 
concentration and wavelength range to be fitted. Multiple dilutions of 
the sample should be prepared that provide an optical density of 
about 0.3, 0.6 and 0.9 at the wavelengths of interests. All samples should
be scanned over the entire wavelength range. Absorption regions that exceed
a certain threshold value (typically 0.9 - 1.0 OD) can automatically 
be excluded from the fit to avoid problems with nonlinearity of absorption.
Overlapping wavelength regions allow the program to properly correlate all
concentrations to eachother. 7 different samples can be prepared in an
8-hole rotor, or 6-channel centerpieces can be used and be scanned at 
different positions in order to generate all needed wavelengths scans in
a single run.

		Click here to add new scanfiles to the fit. You will need at least 
		two scanfiles for a global fit. The more scan information is available,
		the more reliable will be the fit. Try to include scanfiles covering 
		each wavelength of interest with multiple concentrations in a range
		where the XLA spectrophotometer provides linear output (typically 0.0 -
		0.9 OD). You can select multiple files at once in the <a href=
		global_lambda2.png>filedialog</a>. Both uppercase and lowercase wavelength

		This is the run ID used when calling the fitting program from the

		protein absorbance scans for multiple components that may have been
		measured in different runs and have the extinction coefficients of
