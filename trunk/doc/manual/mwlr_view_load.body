    <h2> <i>UltraScan</i> MWL Data Loader: </h2>

    <p> This dialog presents a list of run directories from which to
    select MWL data to load. One of two types of data may be loaded.</p>

    <ul>
      <li><b>Raw MWL</b> The unprocessed .mwrs files of a run.</li>
      <li><b>US3 MWL</b> The already imported US3 .auc files for an
      experiment.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3> Dialog Window: </h3>
    <p> The sample image here results from the main MWLR viewer
    <b>Load Raw MWL Data</b/> being clicked. A very similar dialog is
    shown when <b>Load US3 MWL Data</b/> is clicked.</p>
