    <h2> <i>UltraScan</i> Genetic Algorithm Initialization: </h2>

    <p> Solute distribution data can be used to generate data for use with
    Genetic Algorithm analysis programs. The output data results from choosing
    bins (or buckets) around solute points. These buckets can be modified for
    better results. Once they are as desired, data for Genetic Algorithm
    analysis can be generated and output.</p>

    <p> The input data may come in one of two flavors, each of which is treated
    differently. The data is either SA2D type or Monte Carlo. The SA2D is
    relatively sparse and generally requires fashioning buckets containing a
    single point. For a Monte Carlo distribution, buckets should contain
    multiple points and be constructed around clusters.</p>

    <ul>
       <li>
          <b>Number of Initial Solutes:</b> Choose the number of initial
          solute buckets when using the Autoassign Solute Bins option.
          If 0 or greater than the actual number of input solute points,
          all solute points will be binned. Otherwise, this number limits
          initial bins to those derived from the specified number of
          highest-concentration solute points.
       </li>

       <li>

       <li>
          <b>Automatic Plot Limits</b> Select to automatically set X and Y plot
          range limits or unselect to allow explicitly setting these values.

          <b>(list box)</b> This space is populated with lines giving the
          dimensions of bins generated manually or automatically, and displayed
          in the plot to its right. Clicking of a line causes the associated bin
          plot borders to be highlighted. Double-clicking a line results in the
          associated bin dimension being modified according to the bucket width
          and height values in the counter above. A right-mouse-button click of
          a line signals removal of the bin, if you default or click Yes in the
          resulting dialog.
       </li>

       <li>
          <b>Plot f/f0 vs s</b> Select to plot f/f0 versus sedimentation

          <b>Autoassign Solute Bins</b> Automatically draw bins around solute
          points, using bucket width and height values specified. If a number
          of initial solutes value is first specified, only that number of the
