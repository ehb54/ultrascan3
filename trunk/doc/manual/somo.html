SOMO - Solution Modeler (Bead Modeler for NMR and X-ray structures):</h2>

The SOMO (SOlution MOdeller) module of UltraScan is a bead modelling
utility that was originally developed by the Rocco and Byron labs,
respectively at the Istituto Nazionale per la Ricerca sul Cancro (IST,
Genova, Italy) and at the University of Glasgow (Glasgow, Scotland,
UK). The original code was mainly written by B. Spotorno, G. Tassara,
N. Rai and M. Nollmann. SOMO is based on a reduced representation of
a biomacromolecule, starting from its atomic coordinates, as a set of
non-overlapping beads of different radii, from which the hydrodynamic
properties can be calculated using the Garcia de la Torre-Bloomfield rigid-body
approach (García de la Torre and Bloomfield, Q. Rev. Biophys. 14:81-139,
1981). The reduced representation is afforded by grouping together atoms
and substituting them with a bead of the same volume, appropriately
positioned. Importantly, the volume of the water of hydration
theoretically bound to each group of atoms can be then added to each
bead. The overlaps between the beads are then removed in sequential
steps, but preserving as much as possible the original surface envelope
of the bead model. The method has been fully validated and reported in the
literature (Rai et al., Structure 13:723-734, 2005). Among the main
advantages of this method over shell-modelling and grid-based procedures
are a better treatment of the hydration water and the preservation of a
direct correspondence between beads and original residues. For instance,
the latter feature could be used to include flexibility effects into
the computations. Furthermore, by identifying and excluding from the
hydrodynamic computations beads that are buried and thus non in contact
with the solvent, a large span in the size of the structures that can
be analysed with this method without loss of precision is obtained:
currently, structures from 5K to 250K have been successfully studied.

In this section you can define the hybridizations, atoms and residues
that need to be interpreted as beads in the bead model generation.
These parameters are collected in different tables that are used 
as the components from which the bead sizes and positions are calculated.
PDB structures can then be converted to bead models based on the bead
parameters defined here.
<ul>
<li>
<b>Add/Edit Hybridization:</b> Use this function to modify the <a href=
"somo-1.png">hybridization table</a>. In this file you need to list all
hybridizations (as defined in Tsai et al., J. Mol. Biol. 290:253-266, 1999)
that will be used for the definitions of all atoms. Each hybridization
requires a name, a molecular weight (given by the sum of the mw of the 
atom being defined plus that of the hydrogen atoms bound to it) and a radius
(in Angstrom units). Load the hybridization file first if one exists, and
add new hybridizations to it by filling out the fields and clicking on
<b><i>"Add Hybridization to File"</i></b></li>
<li>
<b>Add/Edit Atom:</b> Use this function to modify the <a href=
"somo-2.png">atom table</a>. In this file you need to list all
atom details that will be used for the definitions of all residues. Each
atom requires a name, a hybridization, a molecular weight and a radius (in
Angstrom units). The latter two properties are automatically defined once
the proper hybrydization is chosen from the <a href="somo-1.png">hybridization table</a>.
In addition, you need to assign the position of the atom in the molecule.
The options are: 
<ol>
<li>Undefined</li>
<li>Main Chain</li>
<li>Side Chain</li>
<li>Prosthetic Group</li>
<li>Other</li>
</ol>
Load the hybridization file first, then the atom file if one exists, and
add new atoms to it by filling out the fields and clicking on
<b><i>Add Atom to File</i></b>. You can also delete an atom from
the file.</li>
<li>
<b>Add/Edit Residue:</b> Use this function to modify the <a href=
"somo-residue-0.png">residue table</a>. The use of this module is described in
<a href="residue.html">this help file</a>.

In this section you can set all options for different steps in the program.
These options are saved in a system wide config file <pre>
$ULTRASCAN/etc/somo.config</pre> Every time you close the SOMO program,
the currently defined options will be saved in <pre>
$HOME/ultrascan/etc/somo.config</pre>
where they will be reloaded from upon startup.

<li>
<b>ASA Calculation:</b> Use this function to modify the options for
the accessible surface area calculation done with SurfRacer (Tsodikov
OV, Record MT Jr, Sergeev YV.  Novel computer program for fast exact
calculation of accessible and molecular surface areas and average
surface curvature.  J. Comput. Chem. 2002 23:600-609). A detailed
description of this module can be found <a href=somo_asa.html>here</a>.

<b>Overlap Reduction:</b> This module allows you to change the options
and handle the various issues related to bead overlap elimination.
A detailed description of this module can be found <a href=somo_overlap.html>here</a>.

<b>Hydrodynamic Calculations:</b> This module allows you to change
the options for calculating the hydrodynamic parameters from the bead
models. A detailed description of this module can be found <a
href=somo_results.html>here</a>.

<li>
<b>Miscellaneous Options:</b> This module allows you to either automatically
compute from the composition or manually enter the partial specific volume
of your molecule, and to define the volume used for the hydration water
molecules (water of hydration has different properties than "bulk" water).
A detailed description of this module can be found <a href=somo_misc.html>
here</a>.

<li>
<b>Bead Model Output:</b> This module allows you to control output options
to be used during the bead model generation. A detailed description of
this module can be found <a href=somo_bead_output.html>here</a>.

<b>Reset to Default Options:</b> Click on this button to reset all
options to default values. When exiting just after clicking on this
button will reset the config file as well to default options.

These functions control the execution of the SOMO program. The first
step is to select a lookup table by clicking on <i><b>Select Lookup
Table</b></i>. You can create multiple lookup tables for different
conditions.  The lookup table needs to contain all atoms and residues
defined in your molecule to be loaded in the next step. As soon as the
lookup table has been successfully loaded, the <i><b>Load PDB File</b></i>
button will become active and you can load a PDB structure file from
NMR or X-ray crystallography experiments. The file can contain multiple
models and if so, multiple models will be displayed in the list box.
You can only process one model at a time. After selecting the model,
click on <i><b>Build Bead Model</b></i>, which should be active now.
This function will generate the bead model based on the settings selected
above. Alternatively, you can skip all of these steps and load a 
previously generated bead model by clicking on <i><b>Load Bead Model
File</b></i> from the menu. Once bead model generation is completed,
the progress bar will be at 100% and the bead model can be visualized with
<i>Rasmol</i> by clicking on <i><b>Visualize Bead Model</b></i>. <i>Rasmol</i>
needs to be installed in <pre><b>$ULTRASCAN/bin</b></pre> for 32 bit
machines, and <pre><b>$ULTRASCAN/bin64</b></pre> for 64 bit platforms.
You can get a copy of <i>Rasmol</i> from <a href="http://www.umass.edu/microbio/rasmol/">
http://www.umass.edu/microbio/rasmol/</a>. Once a bead model has been
generated, its hydrodynamic parameters can be determined by clicking
on <i><b>Calculate Hydrodynamics</b></i>. A partial list of parameters
can be seen as soon as this calculation is complete by clicking on
<i><b>Show Hydrodynamic Calculations</b></i>. A full list of all the
parameters is also available as a text file.
