      Run Diagnostics and Details - Velocity Data:
    </h2>
    <p>
      Before experimental data can be analyzed, the data needs to be edited
      with the <b><i><font face="Arial,Helvetica">UltraScan</font></i></b>
      editing module. In order to provide you with maximum convenience and
      user friendliness, <b><i><font face=
      "Arial,Helvetica">UltraScan</font></i></b> will automatically execute
      any functions which can be implemented without user intervention. These
      functions include certain diagnostics and analyses. To inform you of
      the results of these automated functions, <b><i><font face=
      "Arial,Helvetica">UltraScan</font></i></b> will display the Run
      Diagnostics/Run Detail window after an experimental data directory has
      been specified, or after an edited run has been loaded by a data
      analysis routine:<br>

    <p>
      This window will inform you about all the salient features of a
      particular experiment and allow you to assign a unique run
      identification to the experiment that will be associated with all data
      analyses performed later on, as well as any result data files that will
      be derived from this data.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <b>Temperature Variation:</b> This plot window shows you the
        temperature of each scan acquired during the experiment. The purpose
        of this plot is to inform you if a temperature variation during this
        run has occured that exceeds the temperature tolerance setting in the
        <a href="config.html">configuration</a> file of <b><i><font face=
        "Arial,Helvetica">UltraScan</font></i></b>. <b>It is important for
        velocity data</b> that the temperature of the run does not vary over
        the course of the run for the following reason: A variation in
        temperature will affect the viscosity and density of the
        buffer/sample solution which cannot be compensated for in the data
        analysis. This will cause the S-value of the sample to vary during
        the course of the run, and most definitely introduce undesired
        inaccuracies in the results.
        <p>
          Clicking on the "Time Plot" button will present you with a <a href=
          "edit4a.png">plot of the time differences</a> between scans. The
          "Time Plot" button will then change to a "Speed Plot" button.
          Clicking on the "Speed Plot" button will then show you a <a href=
          "edit4b.png">plot of the speed</a> at which each scan was recorded.
          Finally, you can recall the <a href="edit4.png">temperature
          plot</a> by clicking on the "Temp. Plot" button, and cycle through
          the different plots by repeatedly clicking on the same button.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Temperature Check:</b> If the temperature check has been exceeded
        during the run, this LCD will show a flashing red light, otherwise,
        the LCD will display a constant green light.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Help Button:</b> clicking on this button will bring up this page.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Cancel Button:</b> After selecting the incorrect directory, or to
        abandon the analysis of the selected run, you can press the
        "<i>Cancel</i>" button to abort. You can also press this button to
        close the Details window if it was opened as part of loading an
        edited velocity dataset.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Accept Button:</b> After entering the Run Identification of the
        selected data, you can click on the "<i>Accept</i>" button to return
        to the main editing window. If you fail to enter a Run
        Identification, a <a href="edit5.png">reminder</a> will pop up to
        prompt you to enter a Run Identification before proceeding. If this
        window is called from a data analysis window, the "<i>Cancel</i>" and
        "<i>Accept</i>" buttons simply close the window.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Data Directory:</b> This is the location where the experimental
        data acquired by the Beckman Data Acquisition program is located.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Run Identification:</b> This is an editable field that allows you
        to enter a unique run identification for your experiment. This
        identification will be associated with all data analyses performed
        later on, as well as any result data files that will be derived from
        this data. Before allowing you to proceed, UltraScan requires that
        this field has a valid entry. A valid entry is any alphanumeric
        character, except a space (" "). If you fail to enter a Run
        Identification, a <a href="edit5.png">reminder</a> will pop up to
        prompt you to enter a Run Identification before proceeding. If this
        window is called from a data analysis window, this field can't be
        edited and simply will display the Run Identification that was
        entered during the editing process.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Cells with Data:</b> This field will indicate which cell
        position(s) in the rotor where acquired in the experiment. Valid
        numbers: 1-8. In velocity runs, cell #8 is reserved for the
        counterbalance.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Avg. Temperature:</b> The average temperature of the run resulting
        from all scans in the experiment.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Time Correction:</b> The time correction resulting from the rotor
        acceleration period. Subtracting this number from the time of the run
        will result in the theoretical time that would have been observed if
        it would have been possible to start the run at exactly the rotor
        speed setting from the experiment. During the acceleration period the
        rotor is not spinning at constant speed, so a time correction is a
        good way to correct for that. It is obtained by subtracting the time
        of the scan from the Omega-square-t value recorded in the scan file.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Length of Run:</b> The time point at which the last scan of the
        experiment was taken.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Rotor Speed:</b> The rotor speed setting of the experiment.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Cell Description:</b> This is the description of the cell contents
        that were entered at the time of data acquisition. This field is
        editable and you can update or change this information at this time.
        When this window is called from a data analysis window, any changes
        in this field will remain without effect.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Cell Listbox:</b> This box allows you to review the <i>Cell
        Description</i>, <i>Wavelengths</i> and <i>Scans</i> acqired for each
        cell. As you scroll through this box and click on individual cells,
        the information in the respective fields will be updated for you to
        review.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Wavelengths:</b> The wavelength selection for the data. For
        absorbance data, there are up to 3 different selections available.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Scans:</b> The number of scans for each wavelength acquired.
      </li>
