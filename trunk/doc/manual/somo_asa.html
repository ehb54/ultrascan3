<p>
In this module, you can set the parameters and options for calculating the
Accessible Surface Area (ASA) of your structure. This information is then
used by the model builder to discriminate exposed from buried beads, allowing
the exclusion of the latter from the hydrodynamic computations.The ASA module
is an implementation of SurfRacer, kindly provided by O.V. Tsodikov (Tsodikov
OV, Record MT Jr, Sergeev YV.  Novel computer program for fast exact
calculation of accessible and molecular surface areas and average surface
curvature. J. Comput. Chem. 2002 23:600-609).
<br>In the <i>ASA Probe Radius (A)</i> field, you set the radius of the
hypothetical water molecule used to probe the surface of the molecule for 
accessibility. The default value is 1.4 Angstroms.
<br>In the <i>ASA Threshold (A^2)</i> field, you set the accessible surface
area threshold above which a main- or side-chain will be considered 
exposed to the solvent. The default value is 10 A<sup>2</sup>.
<br>The <i>Bead ASA Threshold %</i> field lets you set the % of the surface
of a bead that must be at least accessible to re-classify as exposed a bead
previously considered to be buried. Beads are initially assigned as being
buried or exposed based on the status of the main- or side-chain they represent.
However, during overlap removal some beads initially classified as buried may
become exposed, hence the need to recheck their status. This operation is 
performed if the <b>Re-check bead ASA</b> checkbox is selected (recommended).
The default value is 30%.
<br>The ASA computation on the intial structure can be excluded by deselecting
the <b>Perform ASA Calculation</b> checkbox (not recommended).
