<H2>Finite Element Results Interpretation:</H2>
<p>
After a fitting session has converged, the finite element analysis will
result in data that can be used to calculate molecular weights or partial
specific volumes, if the molecular weight is know from a different source.
<p> Press on the <a href=predict3.png><i>Model Results</i></a> button in
the <a href=finite_model_ctrl4.png>model control window</a> to see the possible
models that would be consistent with the calculated parameters.  Make sure
to click on <i>Update for 20<sup>o</sup>,W</i> before modeling any results
in order to correct all data for the proper buffer, temperature and vbar
values. You can also update the models from within the modeling window.
Three hyposthetical models are presented:
<p>
<ul>
<li>Prolate Ellipsoid
<li>Oblate Ellipsoid
<li>Long Rod
</ul>
<p>
In addition, the frictional coefficient <i>f</i>, the frictional ratio
<i>f/f0</i>, the volume of the particle, the radius of the minimal sphere
and the frictional of the minimal sphere are shown. The minimal sphere is
the sphere that has the same volume as the modeled particle. 
<p>
<b>Special considerations:</b>
<p>
How reliable are these calculations? The reliability of these hypothetical
models is dependent on the adequacy of the model used for the finite
element fit. If the model used for the nonlinear least squares fit can be
used to accurately describe the underlying physical system, the models
are all equally likely. Of course, there exists no information that would
tell you which of these three models is the most likely. The frictional
information derived from the finite element fit is degenerate, in the sense
that many different models can be used to explain the frictional coefficient
ratio <i>f/f0</i> observed. Therefore, these data can only be used to 
suggest a possible interpretation of the system at hand.
<p>
How adequate a particular fitting model is, is very difficult to
determine. In the first place, it is of course required that the data
were fit with a fitting model wich produces residuals that scatter
randomly about zero. In general, it can be stated that if the same model
can be used to fit the same system under many different conditions
such as different run speeds, concentrations and run durations
it is quite likely that the model describes adequately the system
under investigation. Therefore, it is recommended to fit multiple run
conditions of the same system, and if possible, in a single global fit
(this functionality is available in the future release of the Beowulf
version of the UltraScan software).
<p>
If the same model can be applied to all run conditions, the confidence
in the resulting parameters is higher than if only a single run
condition is examined.  A special case is found if the frictional ratio,
<i>f/f0</i>, is equal to unity. In such a case it is possible that the
sample is spherical in shape. Even though a unity value for <i>f/f0</i>
is indicative of a spherical shape, it is also possible that the model
which produced a unity <i>f/f0</i> ratio is the result of an incorrect
fitting model. 
<p>
In the most obvious case even a ratio less than unity is possible. In this
case a <a href=predict3a.png> warning message</a> is printed and the model
used to arrive at the values can be considered invalid since there is no
physical possibility for this to occur. In that case the frictional ratio
will be <a href=predict3b.png>printed in red</a> to alert the user to the
problem. Such a ratio will most likely occur because a heterogeneity in
the sample has been compensated for by a too large diffusion coefficient.
In the worst case scenario a gaussian distribution of particle sizes will
produce a boundary spreading that can be compensated quite well with
a larger diffusion coefficient, since a larger diffusion coefficient
will also produce a similar boundary spreading. Especially in the case
of noisy data or low concentrations of secondary components, this error
may occur quite readily.
