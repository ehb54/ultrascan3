You can start this model from the <a href=menu_simulation0.png>Simulation
Menu</a> entry in the Main Menu.  Given a combination of two
experimentally determined parameters (sedimentation coefficient,
diffusion coefficient, or molecular weight), this module will allow you
to predict the third parameter and model the molecular dimensions of
a sphere, prolate ellipsoid, oblate ellipsoid and a long rod based on
input parameters. Depending on the experiments performed, you may have
one of the following parameter combinations available:

<p>
<ul>
<li>Molecular Weight and Sedimentation Coefficient
<li>Molecular Weight and Diffusion Coefficient
<li>Sedimentation Coefficient and Diffusion Coefficient
</ul>
<p>
To use this module, select any single combination of parameters by clicking
on the respective button, and then enter the parameters under the field for
parameters 1 and 2. Next, click on the <i>Update</i> button to calculate the 
molecular dimensions for a sphere, an oblate and prolate ellipsoid, as well
as for a long rod. Also calculated are the frictional coefficient and the 
frictional ratio, f/f0, which is a measure of how much a sample deviates
from the frictional properties of a perfect sphere.
<p>
Keep in mind that the solutions to these models are 
purely theoretical and degenerate, there is no information in these parameters
that would allow a definite determination of which model is most appropriate.
The only model that can be excluded is a sphere, if the f/f0 ratio is larger
than 1.
<p>
If the parameters have not been corrected for buffer and temperature (all
results provided by UltraScan from experimental data will be corrected for
buffer and temperature effect, if the buffer has been entered and applied),
use the <i>Density</i> and <i>Viscosity</i> buttons to find the
appropriate values from the <a href=hydro.html>buffer tables</a> or enter
the desired values directly into the respective text fields. Use the
<i>Vbar (20<sup>o</sup>C)</i> button to <a href=vbar.html>estimate</a>
the partial specific volume from a protein sequence, or enter the
partial specific volume, corrected for 20<sup>o</sup>C, directly into the
corresponding text field.
<p>
Always click on the <i>Update</i> button to assure that the changed 
values have been incorporated in the calculation of the models. If you 
enter a selection of values that would give rise to an f/f0 value less 
than unity, a <a href=predict2a.png>warning message</a> is displayed.
In such a case you should re-evalute the validity of the experimental 
results obtained. Please see the section on <a href=finite_interpretation.html>
Finite Element Results Interpretation</a> for more information on this subject.
