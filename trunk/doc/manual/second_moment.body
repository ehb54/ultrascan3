    <h2> <i>UltraScan</i> Second Moment Data Analysis: </h2>

    <p>The second moment analysis will calculate weight-average sedimentation
    coefficients for each scan included in the analysis by finding the second
    moment point in the boundary. The second moment analysis can serve as a
    valuable diagnostics tool in identifying problems such as time-dependent
    degradation, aggregation and even concentration dependency. It is
    important to keep in mind that the second moment analysis is only
    valid for scans that have cleared the meniscus and still have a stable
    plateau. All other scans should be excluded from the analysis.</p>
