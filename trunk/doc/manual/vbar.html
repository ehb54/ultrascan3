<h2>Peptide Properties Calculations:</h2>
<center><img src="vbar1.png">
</center>
<p>This utility allows you to calculate the following properties of a peptide
based on the sequence:
<p>
<ol>
<li>Calculate the estimated molecular weight of a polypeptide
<li>Estimate the partial specific volume of a protein and correct
the v-bar value to the temperature of your experiment
<li>Estimate the extinction coefficient at 280 nm of the denatured protein
according to the method by Gill and von Hippel.
<li>List the amino acid composition of a peptide
</ol>
<p>
<b>Note:</b> This program will utilize the database backend of
<b><i>UltraScan</i></b>. This functionality allows you to save certain
files and data in a database, among them the peptide files analyzed
with this module. If the database system is not supported or available
on your system, you will get a <a href=db-error1.png>warning message</a>
when opening this module.
<p>
The peptide properties calculation module can be loaded in one of three ways:
<p>
<ol>
<li>Click on <a href="menu_utilities0.png">"Calculate Protein MW and vbar"</a>
in the Utility Menu from the Main Menu of <b><i>UltraScan</i></b>.
<li> Click on the vbar button from within any of the analysis windows in <b><i>
 UltraScan</i></b>
<li>Through the database function <a href=menu_database1.png><b>"Commit 
Data to DB:Buffer"</b></a>
</ol>
<p>When using the second option, the temperature of the experiment will automatically 
be used to correct the partial specific volume obtained from the sequence 
analysis.

<b>Peptide Sequence Loading:</b><br>
You can load peptide sequences into this program by one of two methods:
<ol>
<li><b>Load Sequence from HD</b><br>
Use this button to load an ASCII sequence file from your harddrive. A file
dialog will open and allow you to search for *.pep files.  The protein
file should have the extension ".pep" and should be located in your 
<a href="config.html"><b><i>UltraScan</i></b> Root Directory</a>.
<p>
<li><b>Query Peptide from DB</b><br>
If you are using a database backend for <b><i>UltraScan</b></i> you can query
the database for peptide sequence files that have previously been committed
to the database. Sequence files available in the database will be listed in the listbox
once you click on this button. More information about various database functions is
available <a href=database.html>elsewhere</a>.
</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>
<img src=vbar3a.png align=center>
</td>
<td>
<li><b>Select Investigator:</b> When searching for peptide sequences from
the database, you can limit your search to only those sequences belonging
to a specific investigator in the database. When you click on this button,
the <a href=tbl_investigator.html> investigator selection dialog</a>
will open up and allow you to select the desired investigator. When the
sequence is loaded from the database, this option is disabled, since an
investigator is already associated with the selected sequence.  Also,
when committing a sequence to the database an investigator needs to be
chosen to be associated with the sequence.
</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>
<img src=vbar3.png align=center>
</td>
<td>
<li><b>Help:</b> Show this help file
<li><b>Close:</b> Close this function
<li><b>Save Peptide to DB:</b> Use this function to save a peptide sequence to
the database.  Before storing a sequence in the database, you need to have
a copy of the sequence stored locally, for example, on your harddrive.
You can then select the sequence to be stored in the database from
a <a href=vbar5.png>filedialog</a> and after selection, <a
href=vbar6.png> commit</a> the sequence to the database.
<li><b>Delete Sequence from DB:</b> Delete the selected sequence from the database.
This function requires <a href=administrator.html>administrator</a> privileges.
<li><b>Download Sequence: </b>This button will open a <a
href="download_pep.html"> Netscape window</a> with a link to the <a
href="http://www.expasy.ch">Swiss Protein Database Search form</a>. From
there, you can search and download the sequence for your protein (provided
it is already entered into the Swiss Protein Database). After finding
the appropriate sequence, save it as "text" with the extension ".pep"
in your <a href="config.html"><b><i>UltraScan</i></b> Root Directory</a>
<li><b>More Information:</b> Clicking on this button allows you to
review the amino acid composition and the vbar calculation results. The results
are always written to a file called <a href="vbar_res.txt">&lt;peptide file
 name&gt;.res</a>
<li><b>Peptide Reset:</b> Clear the loaded peptide sequence from memory
</td>

  <li><b>Selected File:</b> The location of a <a
  href="http://www.expasy.ch">Swiss Protein database</a> sequence entry
  file that can be imported directly into <b><i>UltraScan</i></b>. See
  also the information on the "Download Sequence" button. This field is 
  blank if the sequence was retrieved from the database, and only applies
  to sequences loaded from the harddrive.</li>
  <br>
  <li><b>Protein Description:</b> The name of the protein</li>
  <br>
  <li><b>Temperature (in <sup>o</sup>C):</b> The temperature of the 
experiment</li>
  <br>
  <li><b>vbar (temperature):</b> The partial specific volume of the 
protein corrected to the experimental temperature</li>
  <br>
  <li><b>vbar (20 <sup>o</sup>C):</b> The partial specific volume of 
the protein at 20<sup> o</sup>C. All vbar calculations are based on the method 
by Cohn and Edsall (<i>Proteins, Amino Acids and Peptides as Ions and Dipolar 
Ions. </i>New York. Reinhold, 1943.)</li>
  <br>
  <li><b>E280 (denatured):</b> The extinction coefficient at 280 nm 
for the peptide in a denatured form based on the method by Gill and von Hippel 
in <i>Anal. Biochem.</i> 182:319-326 (1989). This number is based on the 280
absorbance of Tyrosine, Cysteine and Tryptophan in 6 M urea. Use at your own
risk - measuring this value will be more accurate. <b><i>UltraScan</i></b>
  will require extinction coefficients for the calculation of equilibrium 
constants.</li>
  <br>
  <li><b># of Residues:</b> The number of amino acids in the sequence</li>
  <br>
  <li><b>Molecular weight</b>: The theoretical molecular weight obtained 
by summing the partial amino acid molecular weights, and subtracting one less
water molecules than amino acid residues present.</li>

<p>
You can generate your own peptide sequence file, and import them into
<b><i>UltraScan</i></b>, provided the sequence file follows the correct
sequence file format:
<p>
<b>Required Fields in Database file: </b>When generating your own sequence
 file, you will have to follow the Swiss Protein Database file format convention.
 However, not all fields are required for correct sequence parsing. The fields 
that are required are:  
<ul>
  <li> "DE" - Sequence Description tag. Prepend any description line with 
this tag to identify the description of the sequence. Note: Only the first 
line is parsed, all others are ignored. There can only be one sequence/file.</li>
  <br>
  <li> "SQ" - Sequence Entry. Use this tag to identify the start of 
the sequence in a line preceeding the actual sequence, In the line following 
the sequence place the end-of-sequence marker "//"</li>
  <br>
  
</ul>
