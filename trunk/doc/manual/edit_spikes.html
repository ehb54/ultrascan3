<H2>Editing Spikes and other Optical Imperfections:</H2>
<p>
The purpose of this routine is to allow editing of experimental data
with flaws such as spikes and scratches. These imperfections occur from
time to time, either due to electrical noise in the data acquisition 
system, due to failed lamp flashes, missing CCD points or scratches in
the cell windows. Eliminating such imperfections is appropriate as long
as the overall shape of the concentration gradient is not altered.
<p>
To edit the spike in scan 13 from this <a
href=edit_spikes1.png>example</a>, click on the single-arrow counter
button until it reads "13". The selected scan will be highlighted in
purple to assist you in finding the appropriate scan.

<p>
If you click on the double- or triple-arrow buttons, you can move around in
steps of 10 or 100, which may be useful if you have a large number of scans in
your dataset; keeping the mousebutton depressed on the arrow buttons
will update the counter without redrawing the screen until the button
is released. This trick avoids lengthy redraws on slow video cards,
which can be especially important if your dataset contains many scans.
<p>
Once you found the appropriate scan, click on the
<b>"Edit Single Scan"</b> button, which will bring up a <A
HREF="edit_spikes2.png">window</A> showing the selected scan
by itself. Use the mouse to <A HREF="edit_spikes3.png">drag
a box</A> around the problem area. Releasing the mouse will <a
href="edit_spikes4.png">rescale</a> the graph within the limits of the
bounding box created earlier. This process can be repeated until the
<A HREF="edit_spikes5.png">desired zoom level</A> is attained. Note:
the program will automatically autoscale the y-axis, therefore it is not
necessary to include everything in the y-axis frame. Only the x-limits
are relevant.

<p>
Once the desired zoom level is reached, the zoom function has to be turned
off by clicking on the <b>"Turn Zoom Off"</b> button. You can also
turn zooming back on to further enhance the problem region, but the zooming
has to be turned off before you can select the problem point with the mouse.
<p>
Next, you can click with the mouse near the problem point and it
will be <A HREF="edit_spikes6.png">highlighted with red crosshairs</A>.
Find the position that the problem point <i>should</i> be located,
point to it with the mouse and click.  You can click as many times as
you want until you are <A HREF="edit_spikes7.png">satisfied </A> with the
new location of the point.  <b>Note:</b> Each time you move the point,
the plot area will be autoscaled to best distribute the points on the
available screensize, which may lead to a somewhat jagged appearance
of the points. Once they are re-scaled to their proper dimension, they
will appear normally again. Once you have found the optimal position for
the point, click on the <b>Accept</b> button. This will return
you to the main editing screen, which will now display the <a href=edit_spikes8.png>corrected
scan</a>.
