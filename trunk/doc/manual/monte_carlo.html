<h2>
Monte Carlo Data Analysis:</h2>
The Monte Carlo analysis as implemented in <b><i>UltraScan</i></b> is a 
method that allows you to evaluate statistical parameters of your fit.
You start the Monte Carlo analysis by clicking on the 
Monte Carlo buttons in a nonlinear least squares fitting module for the
various experimental analyses. The <a href="monte_carlo1.png">Monte 
Carlo Analysis Window</a> will appear. This function is used to control
the Monte Carlo modeling of the fitting parameters.
If you are not familiar with Monte Carlo analysis, you are encouraged
to consult a good statistics text book, or review the 
<a href=monte_carlo_tutorial.html>mini-tutorial</a> from UltraScan.
<p>
The Monte Carlo Simulation program allows you to generate the equivalent of 
multiple experimental observations by simulating experimental noise using
a random number generator. Each simulated observation can then be refitted and
provide a new parameter vector of estimated best fit solutions. The collection
of parameters can then be used to derive statistical measurements that allow
you to assign a confidence to the obtained parameter value.
<p>
<b>Explanation of Fields:</b>
<p>
<ul>
<li><b>Output File:</b>
<p>
<img src=monte_carlo2.png>
<p>
With this button, you can select an output file for the Monte Carlo
iterations.  By default, the name of the run (velocity) or the project 
name (equilibrium) is used and ".mc"
are appended. In the case of velocity experiments, the cell and wavelength 
number are also included in the output filename, to avoid overwriting
outputs from different cells of the same run. For equilibrium experiments,
the model number of the equilibrium fit is also incorporated into the filename.
<p>
You can also enter a filename by hand in the dialog
field.  Make sure to enter the full path, and not just the filename. By
clicking on the checkboxes for the append or overwrite mode, you can
select if the output file is created new (overwrite) or if information
is simply appended to the information that has been previously collected
(either in a previous Monte Carlo session or in a simultanous Beowulf
session).
<p>
<li><b>Monte Carlo Data Type:</b>
<p>
<img src=monte_carlo3.png>
<p>
This function allows you to determine the composition of your simulated
data. Your options are "Bootstrap", "Normal Gaussian" or "Mixed". In the 
normal Gaussian mode (the default), synthetic data will be generated
based on the selected data generation rule. The following options exist:
<p>
<ol>
<li><b>Standard Deviation of Point:</b><br>
In this method, the standard deviation of the original datapoint will be
used to generate a random noise deviation with the probability proportional
to the original's datapoint variation. This is the default.
<p>
<li><b>Standard Deviation of Run of Point:</b><br>
In this method, the standard deviation of the original datapoint will be
used to generate a random noise deviation with the probability proportional
to the original's datapoint variation, unless the deviation of the datapoint
is <i>less</i> than the deviation of the run variance. In that case, the
variance from the best fit of the original data fit will be chosen.
<p>
<li><b>Standard Deviation of Run:</b><br>
In this method, the variance from the best fit of the original data
fit will be used to generate a new datapoint, again with a Gaussian 
distribution.
<p>
<li><b>Average Rule:</b><br>
When using the Standard Deviation of <i>xxx</i> Point Average, the 
standard deviation of the new point will be generated according to 
the average residuals obtained by using an <i>xxx</i> point Gaussian
smoothing kernel. Once an average deviation has been obtained, it is
used as the basis for a new point with a Gaussian variance.
</ol>
<p>
The bootstrap method utilizes a randomly distributed selection of residuals
from the original fit, which will be added onto the best fit values. These
randomly selected residuals can be mixed with a user-selected percentage
of the residuals from the original fit.  Use the "% of Input Data"
counter to set the percentage of "bootstrapped" residuals vs. original
residuals included in the bootstrapped Monte Carlo. A setting of
0% would be tantamount to fitting the original data, while a setting
of 100% would randomly pick and rearrange the residuals from the original
fit to create a dataset that has the same residuals, but all are placed at
different points in the data.
<p>
If you select "Mixed", you can specify the percentage of points that will
have a random normal Gaussian noise distribution added, the rest of the
points will have bootstrapped residuals. For example, if you select 75%
for the setting "% of Normal Gaussian", then 75% of the datapoints will
have random Gaussian-distributed residuals that are generated based on
the standard deviation of the original fit, the rest of the datapoints
will be bootstrapped according to the setting under "Bootstrap" and
"% of Input Data". If the percentage of Gaussian generated points is
larger than 0%, the selected percentage of Gaussian datapoints will be
generated with the same Rule set as selected in the pure Gaussian method.
<p>
<b>Note:</b><br>
All percentages listed will be approximate only, since a random number
generator cutoff scheme is used to allocate percentages. Please consult
the <a href=monte_carlo_tutorial.html>Monte Carlo Tutorial</a> for 
suggestions and hints on which method and rule is the most appropriate
for a given application.
<p>
<li><b>Ignore Runs with Variance above:</b>
<p>
On occasion, a fit may fail to converge, in which case the variance
of this Monte Carlo iteration will be unreasonably large. Setting a 
cutoff value here allows filtering of those errant iterations. The
value can be adjusted after all iterations have completed or during
the run. Clicking on the "Update Parameter" button (see below) will
apply the new limits.
<p>
<li><b>Initial Parameter Guesses Settings:</b>
<p>
<img src=monte_carlo4.png>
<p>
Sometimes, when error surfaces are ill-conditioned, a fitting session may
become stuck in a local minimum, preventing the proper survey of the 
entire error surface. In such cases it often helps to add a little random
noise to the original parameter guesses to start the fit at a different
position in each iteration. This way chances for finding a global minimum
are improved. The disadvantage of this method, however, is that more
iterations will be required to converge the fit. The are three choices for
how to apply the initial guesses:
<p>
<ol>
<li><b>From Original Fit:</b><br>
In this case the same guesse as obtained in the best fit for the original
fit will be used as starting guesses for the next Monte Carlo iteration.
Clearly, this method doesn't provide any random starting points for the 
fit. This method allows for the fit to converge faster, but is less robust
in finding the global optimum.
<p>
<li><b>From Previous Fit:</b></br>
In this case the optimal solution from the previous Monte Carlo iteration
will be used as an initial guess for the next Monte Carlo iteration.
This method provides some minimal random offset for the initial guesses
from one iteration to the next.
<p>
<li><b>With Added Noise:</b></br>
This method will add random noise of the indicated magnitude to each
parameter estimate. The distorted parameter will then be used as an 
initial guess for the next Monte Carlo iteration. This method is the most
robust and should provide even and reliable parameter distributions, even
for very nonlinear cases where parameter estimates may become easily 
trapped in complicated error surfaces. The drawback of this setting is
that additional iterations will be necessary to converge and computational
time will increase. Select the amount of added noise in percent of absorbance
units, generally an offset of 5-10% is quite sufficient to prevent the
solution from getting stuck in a local minimum. If the parameters are 
changed too much, the solution may not converge at all, the correct
amount to use depends on the problem, and should be checked with a few
iterations before committing to a long Monte Carlo calculation.
</ol>

<p>
<li><b>Iteration Information:</b>
<p>
<img src=monte_carlo5.png>
<p>
Under the field "Total Iterations" you can enter a fixed number of total 
iterations that need to be completed before the Monte Carlo session is
finished. I recommend at least 10,000 iterations to obtain reliable
results. The field entitled "Current Iteration" will be updated with 
each iteration performed by this session. If other sessions (SMP or Beowulf)
are writing to the same output file, this information will be captured 
automatically and the "Current Iteration" field will be updated automatically.
The "Random Seed" field will list a computer-generated seed (the process
ID XORed with the system time) to generate a somewhat random seed for the
randomization of the Monte Carlo data type. You can also enter an arbitrary
integer value if you prefer to use your own seed. Random seeds are necessary
since they prevent using the same random sequence start point in different
Monte Carlo sessions. To make sure that no parallel session utilized the same
seed, you can compare the entries in the second column of the output file,
they contain the random seed used in the Monte Carlo session.
<p>
<li><b>Parameter Information:</b>
<p>
<img src=monte_carlo6.png>
<p>
This listbox can be used to select the Monte Carlo statistics for a 
specific parameter that is being fitted in the Monte Carlo analysis.
Double - click on the desired parameter to view the parameter distribution
as well as other statistics.
<p>
<li><b>Monte Carlo Information:</b>
<p>
<img src=monte_carlo7.png>
<p>
Each time you select a different parameter with the listbox above, the 
Mean Value (and all other statistics) are recalculated. The Mean Value is
displayed in the top line. In the next line, you can enter the number of
bins used in generating the frequency distribution of the parameter values
that have been generated in the Monte Carlo analysis. The smaller the bin
number, the larger the bin size and the more datapoints will be counted in
each bin. The last line lists the number of datapoints available from
previous iterations that have already been completed.
<p>
<li><b>Monte Carlo Control Panel:</b>
<p>
<img src=monte_carlo8.png>
<p>
<b>"Update Parameter":</b> The Monte Carlo output file is read and the 
current parameter is updated. This function is useful if you use the 
software in a Beowulf or SMP system with multiple sessions writing to the 
same file. In that case you can monitor the progress of the other sessions
from the local session.
<p>
<b>"Statistics":</b> This button will call the <a
href=monte_carlo_stats.html>Monte Carlo Statistics window</a> for an
update of the statistics for the currently selected parameter. With
each iteration performed by the local session, this window is updated
automatically if it remain opened. Clicking on the "Update Parameter"
button also will update the statistics window.  No statistics are
calculated until at least 100 iterations have been completed.

<p>
<b>"Print Histogram":</b> Print a copy of the current histogram to your
printer.
<p>
<b>"Save Data":</b> Save a copy of the statistics and histogram information
to an ASCII file. See <a href=file_format.html>File Structures and Formats</a>
for details on the file format used.
<p>
<b>"Start" and "Stop":</b> These buttons are used to control the Monte Carlo
Fitting process. You can start or stop the process. When stopped, the 
current iteration will complete before the fitting is altogether stopped.
The buttons are logically linked, and disabled when not appropriate for use.
<p>
<b>"Help":</b> This help menu.
<p>
<b>"Close":</b> Close the application.
<p>
<li>Histogram Parameter Distribution:
<p>
<img src=monte_carlo9.png>
<p>
This plot shows a histogram of the distribution of all parameter values, 
sorted into bins of size (maximum value - minimum value) / (number of bins).
The number of bins (and hence the size of bins) can be adjusted with the
Monte Carlo information field "Number of Bins:" (see above). No plots 
or statistics are shown until at least 20 iterations have been completed.
<p>
On occasion a fit may fail to converge and will produce unreasonable
answers, causing a <a href=monte_carlo10.png>distortion of the histogram
plot</a>. In such a case you can graphically crop the subset of data
with reasonable values by dragging the mouse over the desired region
in the plot. Only the x-axis limits of the bounding rectangle will
apply. You can repeat this cropping process repeatedly, until all
unreasonable data <a href=monte_carlo11.png>have been eliminated</a>. In
most cases unreasonable values (for example, of the variance) translate
into unreasonable values in the histograms of other parameters. As you
crop datapoints in the histogram of one parameter, the corresponding
datapoints from all other parameters for the run that gave unreasonable
values will be eliminated as well. The adjustment of iterations will be
reflected in the field for "# of Data Points" and "Current Iteration".
<p> If you make a mistake, you can reset the distribution by clicking on
"Update Parameter", which will re-initialize the parameter distributions
from the file.
