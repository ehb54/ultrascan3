</H2>
<p>
<b>Selecting the proper Model:</b>
<p>
The first step in the finite element analysis of sedimentation
velocity or approach-to-equilibrium data is the definition of
an appropriate model.  Unfortunately, the most difficult step in
this procedure is to decide <i>what</i> exactly the appropriate
model is. To assist you in this decision, you should analyze the
corresponding velocity data with the <a href=vhw.html>van
Holde - Weischet Analysis method</a> first.  A good description for
interpreting experimental velocity data by this method can be found in
<a href=http://www.cauma.uthscsa.edu/publications/biophysj-1997>Demeler
et al., 1998</a>.
<p>
As with all methods of fitting imperfect data to a model, the solution
space is degenerate and often many different models, though similar,
can result in the same chi-square value. There are several ways to check
if a particular model is appropriate, the most obvious method is to check
the residuals of the fit. Unless the residuals are randomly scattered
about zero and don't show any systematic drift or runs, you should 
<b><i>not</i></b> use the results, since they will be meaningless.
<p>
The other important rule to keep in mind is that the simplest model that
fits the data is generally more correct than an overdetermined complex
model. The fewer parameters necessary to fit a dataset, the better.
In order to improve the confidence in the results, it is strongly 
recommended to utilize scans from the early beginning of the experiment
until late into the run when the material is almost pelleted. Future 
versions of <i><b>UltraScan</b></i> will include the ability to fit
multiple experiments under different conditions to enhance the information
content of the fitted data.
<p>
Even if a model results in randomly scattered residuals, this is not a 
guarantee that the model is representative of the data. For example, 
a gaussian distribution of s-values due to a gaussian distribution of 
particle sizes (a common occurence) may be approximated by an artificially
high diffusion coefficient, since the boundary spreading due to heterogeneity
will have a similar effect on the shape of the boundary as the spreading
of the boundary due to diffusion. On the other hand, an overdetermined model
with too many parameters may explain the experimental data equally well, but
of course is totally meaningless. For a single velocity experiment, three
separate components may be the maximum of what can be reliably fitted.
Always, the results obtained with
the finite element analysis need to be carefully cross-checked against
other methods before taken for granted.
<p>
<b>Improving the confidence of the Results:</b>
<p>
There are several ways to improve the confidence of your results obtained
from finite element fitting. The most obvious method of improving the 
confidence of individually fitted parameters is to reduce the number of
parameters fitted simultaneously. For example, if you have measured the 
molecular weight of a sample by mass spectroscopy or gel electrophoresis,
or if the molecular weight is known from the sequence of the protein or
nucleic acid, the molecular weight could be fixed during the fit, which will
also fix the diffusion coefficient and constrain the fit. Another method for
improving the confidence of the fit is to utilize only clean and noise-free 
data. The higher the signal to noise ratio, the better the confidence in
the fitted results. The same holds true for data obtained from a wider range
of experimental conditions. A particular model needs to hold for all
conditions (such as varying the speed or loading concentration) and should
ideally result in the same result. If the results differ from run to run,
the model is most likely inappropriate.
<p>
<b>Fitting Strategies:</b>
<p>
In order to succeed in fitting sedimentation data to finite element 
solutions, it helps to follow the steps outlined below:
<p>
<ul>
<li>It is generally best to start with a simple model, such as a single ideal,
non-interacting system. 
<li>Obtain initializing guesses from the van Holde -
Weischet analysis
<li>Start with a large time discretization for an initial approximation of the
the data (it goes faster), then refine the model with a smaller stepsize once
the fitted data is close to the final answer. Use the unconstrained method
for unknown data and refine the fit with the constrained method. Make sure
the constraints are not too close to the final answer, or the solution
matrix may turn singular.
<li>Float as few parameters as possible to assure a high confidence in each
<li>Try different starting guesses to make sure the solution converges always
to the same answer
<li>If at first the fit doesn't succeed, try a different model and/or 
different initialization parameters.
<li>Utilize information known from other experiments to supplement the 
information gained from finite element. For example, measure the partial
specific volume of the sample separately to constrain the molecular weight.
</ul>
