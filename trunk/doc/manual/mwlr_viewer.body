    <h2> <i>UltraScan</i> Multi-Wavelength Raw Data Viewer: </h2>

    <p> This module presents options for viewing multi-wavelength data
    for purposes of quality control. The user may, in this way, identify
    any problems in the experiment and get a sense of the wavelength,
    radial, and intensity ranges represented.</p>

    <p> Two types of input may be loaded for viewing.</p>

    <ul>
      <li><b>Raw MWL</b> The unprocessed .mwrs files of a run.</li>
      <li><b>US3 MWL</b> The already imported US3 .auc files for an
      experiment.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3> Process:</h3>

    <ul>
       <li>
          <b>Load MWL Data:</b> Load multi-wavelength data to view by
          clicking on "Load Raw MWL Data" or "Load US3 MWL Data", depending
          on the available or desired data type.
       </li>

       <li>
          <b>Define 2-D Plot and Ranges:</b> Set radius and lambda ranges;
          determine averaging count; choose the X-axis (radius or lambda);
          and possibly use the plot window Config option to refine the
          resulting 2-dimensional plot.
       </li>

       <li>
          <b>Show a 2-D Movie:</b> Once a 2-D plot and its ranges have been
          established, show a 2-D movie of all lambda/radius records to
          view the progression of data through record ranges.
       </li>

       <li>
          <b>Show and Refine 3-D Plot:</b> Click on "Plot 3D" to bring up
          a control window. Within that dialog, choose scales and bring up
          a 3-D plot window. Continue to refine scales and orientation until
          the 3-D plot is as desired.
       </li>

       <li>
          <b>Show a 3-D Movie:</b> Once a 3-D plot, with its scales and
          orientation, has been established, show a 3-D movie to see the
          change in data over time (scans). Note that scans may be excluded
          and a range of scans chosen to refine this movie.
       </li>

       <li>
          <b>Save Plots and Movies:</b> When plots and movies are all in
          a desired and informative state, you may save the plots and save
          frame files from the movies for processing by external imaging
          software.
       </li>
    </ul>

    <h3> Main Window: </h3>
    <p> The main MWLR_Viewer window is shown here in the state it appears
    after loading US3 MWL data.</p>

    <h3> Alternate Record and X-axis:</h3>
    <p> The default 2-D plot and movie frames is of wavelength records with radius
    as the X axis. You may change to radius records with lambda as the X axis by
    checking the <b>X-axis Wavelength</b> box. With this checked, the main window
    would be similar to the following.</p>
