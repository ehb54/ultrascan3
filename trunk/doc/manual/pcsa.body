    <h2> <i>UltraScan</i> Parametrically Constrained Spectrum Analysis: </h2>

    <p> This module enables you to perform parametrically constrained
    spectrum analysis on a chosen experimental data set. Upon completion of
    an analysis fit, plots available include: model lines; experiment;
    simulation; overlayed experiment and simulation; residuals;
    time-invariant noise; radially-invariant noise; 3-d model.
    Final outputs may include a model and computed noises.</p>

    <p> The PCSA method is used for composition analysis of sedimentation
    velocity experiments. It can generate sedimentation coefficient,
    diffusion coefficient, frictional coefficient, f/f0 ratio, and molecular
    weight distributions. The distributions can be plotted as 3-dimensional
    plots (2 parameters from the above list against each other), with the
    third dimension representing the concentration of the solute found in the
    composition analysis. The set of all such final calculated solutes form a
    model which is used to generate a simulation via Lamm equations. The
    simulation is plotted overlaying a plot of experimental data.</p>

    <p> The PCSA pass proceeds for a set of models each of which consists of
    the solute points along a curve in s,f/f0 space. The model whose RMSD of
    the resulting residuals (simulation-experimental difference) is the lowest
    forms the starting point for a second phase which uses Levenberg-Marquardt
    to refine the model to a final output model. The set of initial curves is
    specified by a s and f/f0 ranges and a direct or implied number of variations
    in f/f0 end-points or sigmoid par1, par2 values. The type of curve used
    may be any of the following.</p>

    <ul>
      <li><b>Straight Line</b></li>
      <li><b>Increasing Sigmoid</b></li>
      <li><b>Decreasing Sigmoid</b></li>
      <li><b>Horizontal Line [ C(s) ]</b></li>
    </ul>

    <h3> Process:</h3>

    <ul>
       <li>
          <b>Load Experimental Data:</b> First, load experimental velocity
          data. Click on "Load Data" to select an edited velocity data set from
          the database or from local disk.
       </li>
          
       <li>
          <b>Define the Analysis Fit:</b> Secondly, open an analysis
          control window by clicking on "Fit Control". Within that dialog,
          define the ranges and counts that comprise the analysis.
       </li>
          
       <li>
          <b>Start the Fit:</b> Next, after having specified analysis
          parameters, begin the fit analysis by clicking "Start Fit".
       </li>
          
       <li>
          <b>Display and Save Results:</b> After simulation, a variety of
          options are available for displaying simulation results, residuals,
          and distributions. Report text files and graphics plot files can
          also be generated.
       </li>
    </ul>

    <h3> Main Window: </h3>
    <p> The main PCSA window is shown here in the state it appears after
    the completion of a fit run.</p>

    <h3> The Curves: </h3>

    <p> After specifying the curve type and the variations to analyze, a plot
    of the model lines may be displayed. The sample shown here is for a
    Straight Line type.</p>

    <p> After analysis, the display is modified to illustrate the best model,
    as well as color coding of some of the other better fits. The sample
    here is for an Increasing Sigmoid type.</p>
