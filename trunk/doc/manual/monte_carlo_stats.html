Monte Carlo Statistics:</h2>

<p>This panel shows the various statistical measurements for the Monte Carlo
distributions of each parameter.
<p>
<b>Explanation of Fields:</b>
<p>
Variables used: <I>u</I> is the mean data value (see below), <i>N</i>
refers to the number of observations, and <i>x<sub>i</sub></i> is the
observation <i>i</i>.
<ul>
<li>Maximum and Minimum Value:
<ul>
The <i>maximum</i> and <i>minimum</i> value occuring in the distribution 
for the parameter. The closer these values are together, the smaller the
spread of values and the more reliable is the <i>mean</i>.
</ul>
<p>
<li>Mean Value:
<ul>
The <i>mean</i> is the average value of all measurements: <p>
<center>
<img src=eq1.png>
</center>
</ul>
<p>
<li>Median Value:
<ul>
After sorting the data from lowest to highest, the median is the 'middle'
value or the 50th Percentile, meaning that 50% of the results from the
simulation are less than the median. If there is an even number of data
points, then the median is the average of the middle two points.
<p>
Extreme values can have a large impact on the mean, so the median is often
preferrable for skewed distributions such as the Lognormal distribution. If
the distribution is symmetric (like the Normal distribution), then the mean
and median will be identical."
<p>
The key is that last sentence. IF the distribution is symmetric, then the
median will happen to be the same as (Max+Min)/2 in addition to the mean.
But that is generally not the case for Monte Carlo simulations. The values
of Min and Max can vary dramatically (even when the distribution is
symmetric), but the median does not depend upon the minimum and maximum
values, only the middle point.
<p>
This value should be close to the <i>mean</i> and the <i>mode</i>, if not, the distribution may be 
<i>skewed</i>.
</ul>
<p>
<li> Skew and Kurtosis:
<ul>
The <i>skew</i> and <i>kurtosis</i> measure how the values are distributed
around the mode (see below). A <i>skew</i> value of zero indicates
that the values are evenly distributed on both sides of the mode. A
negative <i>skew</i> indicates an uneven distribution with a higher than
normal distribution of values to the right of the mode, a positive value
for the skew indicates a larger than normal distribution of values to the
left of the mode.
The <i>kurtosis</i> of the distribution indicates how narrow or broad the
distribution is. A positive value for the <i>kurtosis</i> indicates a
narrower distribution than a normal Gaussian, a negative value indicates
a flatter and broader distribution. A normal Gaussian distribution has a
<i>kurtosis</i> of zero. The larger the <i>kurtosis</i> of the parameter,
the better.

</center>
</ul>
<p>
<li>The Mode:
<ul>
The <i>mode</i> is the value in the distribution that occurs most frequently.
Since floating point values rarely repeat, values are collected in bins of
finite size for comparison. The lower limit of the mode refers to the 
lower limit of the bin that has the largest frequency. The upper limit
of the mode is the value of the largest parameter value to still be 
counted in this bin. In a normal distribution the <i>mean</i> = 
<i>mode</i> = <i>median</i>. The larger the difference between these
values, the more the distribution deviates from a normal Gaussian.
</ul>
<p>
<li>Variance:
<ul>
The <I>variance</I> is the sum of squares of the deviations from the
mean, normalized by the number of datapoints. It is given by the expression

<p><center>
<img src=eq6.png>
</center>
<p>
A smaller variance is better.

</ul>
<p>
<li>Standard Deviation:
<ul>
The <I> standard deviation </I>,  commonly denoted by sigma, 
is the <I> square root </I> of the variance 
<p><center>
<img src=eq7.png>
</center>
<p>
This is a standard measure of the <I> spread </I> in data values. The
larger the value of sigma, the larger is the spread in data. If data are
normally distributed, sigma as calculated by Eq.(5) can be substituted
in Eq.(1) to find the probability for a particular data value. The smaller
the standard deviation, the higher is the confidence in the estimated
value.
</ul>
<p>
<li>Standard Error:
<ul>
The <i>standard error</i> is equal to the <i>standard deviation</i> 
devided by the the square-root of the number of observations.
</ul>
<p>
<li>Correlation Coefficient:
<ul>
The <i>correlation coefficient</i> is a measure of how correlated the
datapoints are in the fit. A random distribution should have very little
correlation. A good value here should be around zero.
</ul>
<p>
<li>Gaussian Area:
<ul>
The <i>Gaussian area</i> is the area under the curve described by the bin,
or the distribution of values. 
</ul>
<p>
<li>Monte Carlo Iterations:
<ul>
This is the number of curvefits that were performed in the Monte Carlo
Analysis. It is equivalent to the number of observations for each parameter.
</ul>
<p>
<li>95% and 99% Confidence Intervals: 
<ul>
The <i>confidence intervals</i> identify the probability limits of a 
range between which the true value of the parameter is to be expected 
with a given likelyhood.
In statistics, rather than talk
about the `answer', one gives the mean and a set of upper and lower
limits. For random errors, the limits give the range of values 
within which the actual answer is likely to fall to some level 
of confidence. For example,
the limits for a 90% confidence level give the range of values where we have a
nine in ten chance that the actual answer lies.
<p>
For real
variations in properties between multiple samples, the limits specify
a range in which it is likely to measure some percentage of 
data values. For example,
one can specify limits so that one nine of every ten 
measurements are likely to fall within the range of values 
between those limits; this would be a 90%
confidence level. A 99% confidence level, 
where on average 99 out of 100 measurements
would be found, would require <I>larger</I> confidence limits.
To be sure that each measurement fell within some range of
values (a 100% confidence level) would require limits of
plus and minus infinity; in other words statistically you can 
never be 100% sure of your
answer or possible range of data values!
<p>
Obtaining confidence limits depends on the data distribution.
For a normal probability these limits are reasonably
straight-forward to obtain. If the <i>kurtosis</i> and <i>skew</i>
of the distribution are close to zero, the distribution is similar
to a normal distribution and the confidence limits represent a
good measure of the error range.
For example, say we have a normal distribution with some mean <I>u</I> and
a standard deviation of sigma. The probability of measuring a
data value between 2 x sigma and 3 x sigma would be

<p>
The limits for a particular confidence level for a normal distribution
are simply the limits of integration
on either side of the mean needed so that the integral covers the desired area.
For example, for a 95% confidence level we need to find the upper and
lower limits so that 95% of the area under the curve falls between these
two points. The equation for this is
<p><center>
<img src=eq9.png>
</center>
<p>
where  +/-limit are referred to as the confidence limits, measured in standard
deviations. The desired confidence limit in percentage can be looked up in 
tables, for a 95% confidence interval, the limit should be about 1.96 standard deviations around the mean, for a 99% interval the limit should be about 2.576
standard deviations around the mean.
