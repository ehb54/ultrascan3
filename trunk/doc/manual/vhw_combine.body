    <h2> <i>UltraScan</i> van Holde - Weischet Combined Plots: </h2>

    <p> To combine integral van Holde - Weischet G(s) distributions from
    multiple datasets (either from different cells of the same run or from
    different runs), use "Combine Distribution Plots (vHW)" from the
    Utilities menu. This will allow you to compare integral distributions
    from different cells to each other. This may be useful if you analyzed
    the same sample under different conditions; for example, different pH
    levels or different concentrations. If the samples are the same, the
    distributions should overlay; if the samples behave differently, the
    distributions will be shifted relative to each other.</p>

    <p> All distributions will be plotted relative to the boundary fraction
    used in analysis. For example, if you analyzed 100% of the boundary,
    the distribution will range from 0 % to 100 % of the Y-axis.
    A distribution that was analyzed for 72 % of the boundary, shifted 8 %
    from the bottom will be plotted from 8 % to 80 % of the Y-axis. It is
    important that this distinction be made, since, for example,
    concentration-dependent samples will behave differently depending on the
    position in the boundary; or heterogeneous samples will show different
    distributions depending on which portion of the boundary was analyzed.</p>

    <p> When data are loaded, arrays of X,Y distribution and envelope values
    are read and saved. These are then used to quickly display plots.
    If you want to change the mix of data plotted, you may click the
    Reset Plot button; and then quickly make new selections that are
    plotted without need for recalculations.</p>
