          <b>Help:</b> Bring up this Help window
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Close:</b> Close the equilibrium estimation module and return to
          the main window.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Density (20 C):</b> Call the <a href="hydro.html">buffer
          calculation module</a>. This will calculate the density correction
          for the buffer you selected and correct the density for the
          selected temperature. You can also override the calculation routine
          and enter an known density for your buffer at 20C.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Vbar (20 C):</b> Call the <a href="vbar.html">vbar calculation
          module</a>. This will calculate the vbar for a protein sequence
          from the Swiss Protein Database. You can also override this value
          by providing your own vbar value. The program will automatically
          adjust your value to the selected temperature.

    <div style="margin-left: 2em">
      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>Suggested Speed:</b> This is the best speed for the selected
          settings. Use this speed for your experiment.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Est. MW:</b> Enter here the estimated molecular weight for the
          sample. If there are more than component in this sample, use a
          weight average molecular weight. For monomer-dimer equilibria, use
          the molecular weight of the monomer.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Sigma:</b> Enter the reduced molecular weight sigma. This value
          should ideally be between 2 and 3. If you plan to perform an
          experiment with 3 speeds, select one speed for a sigma value of
          2.0, one for 2.5 and one for 3.0. This value will adjust the
          curvature of the final equilibrium gradient. If this number is too
          small, the gradient will be too shallow, and the information
          content of the experiment is minimal.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Concentration Ratio Rb/Rm:</b> This is the ratio of the
          concentration (fringes or OD) at the bottom of the cell over the
          concentration at the meniscus that will be observed at equilibrium.
          The larger the loading volume, the larger will this ratio be. This
          ratio is directly related to the sigma value for the run.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Column length.</b> The program will calculate the length of the
          column (in mm) according to the rotor stretching and loaded volume.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Loading volume:</b> Enter the amount of sample to be loaded.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Meniscus position:</b> This value is provided to allow you to
          adjust the scanning positions of the XL-A. For short column
          experiments it is often not necessary to scan the entire cell. This
          value will tell you in advance where the meniscus will be. It is a
          good idea to always set the scanning range a few millimeters longer
          than given by this value, in case of pipetting error.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Temperature:</b> Enter the temperature of the run.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Bottom of Cell Position:</b> This program will calculate the
          bottom of the cell based on the rotor stretching and the
          centerpiece used.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Rotor Type:</b> Click on the button corresponding to the rotor
          to be used in the experiment
        </li>
        <li>R<b>otor Overspeed Check:</b> If your settings bring the rotor
        speed above the permitted speed of the selected rotor, a red LCD will
        flash to warn you about the rotor selection.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Centerpiece:</b> Select the appropriate centerpiece.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Centerpiece Overspeed Check:</b> If your settings bring the
          rotor speed above the permitted speed of the selected centerpiece,
          a red LCD will flash to warn you about the rotor selection.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Estimated Number of Datapoints/Scan:</b> This field will show
          you how many datapoints you can expect for the a particular optical
          system for the settings selected. This number is only an estimate
          and will depend in large part on the amount of useful data in your
          scans. For the absorbance optical system, it also requires that you
          use the maximum resolution setting of the XL-A, which is 0.001
          cm/datapoint. However, because of the data acquisition system,
          datapoints will generally only be acquired at a density of about
          0.0016 cm/points on the average.
