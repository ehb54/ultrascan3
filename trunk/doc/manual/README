To make the UltraScan III documentation files for Qt Assistant,
from ultrascan3/doc/manual just run:

  make


This requires that the Qt4 binararies are in the PATH and the Perl 
tool tpage is available.

To get tpage, check your distro for libtemplate-perl or installe it yourself
as root:

sudo cpan -i Template::Tools

See http://template-toolkit.org/docs/index.html
