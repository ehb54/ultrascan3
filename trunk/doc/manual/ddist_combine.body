    <h2> <i>UltraScan</i> Discrete Distributions Combined Plots: </h2>

    <p> To combine model distributions from multiple datasets (either from
    different cells of the same run or from different runs), use
    "Combine Discrete Distributions" from the Utilities menu. This will
    allow you to compare bar plots of distributions from different cells
    to each other. </p>

    <p> Distribution plots present relative concentration (Y) for X points
    where the "X" type may be sedimentation coefficent, molecular weight,
    diffusion coefficient, frictional ratio or vbar (specific density).
    Vertical bars are computed at every 2% mark of the X range. </p>

            <b>Select Run ID(s)</b> Click on this button to open a
            <a href="ddist_combine-selrun.img.html">Run ID Select Dialog</a>
            in which one or more run IDs may be selected from which
            distribution data files can be taken.
        </li>
            
        <li>
            <b>Save Data</b> Save combined discrete distribution plots and
            data to a local data file and, if input source so indicates,
            to the database.
        </li>

        <li>
            <b>Reset Data</b> Clear all data, lists and plots. To choose runs
            and distributions, a new set of Select Run ID(s) selections must
            be made.
        </li>

        <li>
            <b>Reset Plot</b> Clear all plots. Data is still saved, so
            a new set of plots can be created by simply selecting runs
            and distributions (models).

            <b>Save Plot under Project:</b> The name shown to the right of this
            label specifies the project subdirectory under which the combination
            is to be saved. By default, the name shown is the first run
            selected for plotting, but this can be changed by the user to any
            listed name. If "All" is selected, plot copies will be saved to all
            of the component run IDs.
