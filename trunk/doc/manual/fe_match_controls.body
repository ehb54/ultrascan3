    <h2> FE Match Enhanced Plot Controls:</h2>

    <p> Upon completion of FE Match simulation, a dialog of enhanced plot
    controls appears. Its "3D Plot" button launches a 3-dimensional plot
    window whose primary control resides in this dialog. There are size,
    orientation, and other controls that are in the 3D dialog itself.
    The control "Residuals Plot" button launches a set of data and
    residuals plots that are more refined and controllable than those
    in the main FE Match window.</p>

    <h3> Functions: </h3>

    <ul>
       <li>
          <b>Dimensions:</b> The five pairs of check boxes allow the
          user a way to set the 3D plot X and Y dimension value types:
          MW; s20,w; D20,w; f; and f/f0.
       </li>

       <li>
          <b>Z-Scaling Factor:</b> Set the scale factor for 3D Z values,
          to increase/decrease peak extents relative to X and Y.
       </li>

       <li>
          <b>Grid Resolution:</b> Set the number of pixels in X and Y for
          which Z raster values are calculated.
       </li>

       <li>
          <b>Peak Smoothing:</b> Set the smoothing factor applied to peaks.
       </li>

       <li>
          <b>Peak Width:</b> Set the factor that governs the spread of
          peaks.
       </li>

       <li>
          <b>3D Plot</b> Click this button initially to launch the 3D
          plot window. Thereafter, when dimension value or other settings
          are changed, click this button for a re-draw of the 3D plot.
       </li>

       <li>
          <b>Residuals Plot</b> Click to launch the advanced residuals plot.
       </li>

       <li>
          <b>Help</b> Click for this documentation.
       </li>

       <li>
          <b>Close</b> Click to close the control dialog, along with any
          residuals or 3D dialogs it spawned.
       </li>
    </ul>

    <p>Below is a 3D plot window sample. As mentioned, it is controlled
    largely in the Controls dialog. In the 3D window itself, the toolbar
    controls have tool tip text shown when the cursor hovers over each.
    The mouse scroll wheel controls zoom. Left mouse button click and
    hold and mouse movement, as well as arrow keys, control orientation.
    In general, display control is easily learned in playing with the
    mouse and keyboard, sometimes in combination with shift, alt or
    control keys.</p>

    <p>Below is a Residuals plot dialog sample. The check boxes that
    control plot contents are self-explanatory.</p>
