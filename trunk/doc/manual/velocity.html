<b>Velocity Menu:</b>
<p>
These functions allow you to analyze previously edited velocity data
with various velocity analysis methods. 
<p>

<p>
<b><li>Enhanced van Holde - Weischet</b><br>
Analyze velocity data with the enhanced van Holde - Weischet method, a model independent approach
that provides diffusion-corrected S-value distributions. The analysis function
is explained <a href=vhw.html>here</a>. Please also refer to the 
<a href=../tutorial/index.html>van Holde - Weischet tutorial</a> for more background
information on this analysis.
<p>
<b><li>2-D Spectrum Analysis</b><br>
A 2-dimensional spectrum analysis which identifies the composition of mixtures of samples
in terms of sedimentation and frictional properties from velocity experiments. More information
about this method can be found <a href=sa2d.html>here</a>. 
<p>
<b><li>Finite Element (DUD)</b><br>
Analyze velocity data using the finite element analysis with the DUD
fitter (<b>D</b>oesn't <b>U</b>se <b>D</b>erivatives). The finite
element analysis will attempt whole boundary fitting which provides
quantitative results for the sedimentation and diffusion coefficients,
as well as partial concentrations for each component. The DUD nonlinear
least squares fitter is fairly robust and works well for most problems
and on machines with memory limitations.  More information about this
function can be found <a href=finite.html>here</a>.
<p>
<b><li>C(s) analysis</b><br>
This method provides sedimentation coefficient distributions and average frictional
ratios by the C(s) approach by P. Schuck. More information about this method can be 
found <a href=cofs.html>here</a>.
<p>
<b><li>Finite Element Model Viewer</b><br>
This routine will take a velocity experiment and calculate residuals for a user-provided
finite element model. This model can be obtained either from a 2-D spectrum analysis, 
C(s) analysis, or manually generated with the Finite Element Simulator. More information
is available <a href=fematch.html>here</a>.
<p>
<b><li>Initialize GA Grid</b><br>
This routine will take a sedimentation distribution from either the van Holde - Weischet
analysis, the 2-dimensional spectrum analysis, the finite element nonlinear least squares
fitting analysis, or the C(s) analysis and create a Genetic Algorithm initialization file
that can be 
used to initialize the parallel supercomputer interface for the genetic algorithm analysis.
More information is available <a href=ga_initialize.html>here</a>.
<p>
<b><li>Second Moment</b><br>
The second moment analysis allows you to analyze velocity data for weight-average
sedimentation coefficients. This method is useful for diagnostics such as 
aggregation, degradation, concentration dependency and time dependent trends.
More information about this function can be found <a href=sm.html>here</a>.
<p>
<b><li>Time Derivative</b><br>
The time derivative method allows you obtain g(s) distribtutions (not diffusion
corrected) of your velocity data. The benefit of this method is its ability to
automatically subtract out time-invariant noise that is often present at significant
amounts in interference data. The time derivative method incurs a penalty of random 
noise by a factor of squareroot of 2. More information about this function can i
be found <a href=dcdt.html>here</a>.
<p>
<b><li>Radial Derivative</b><br>
The radial derivative methods allows you to find the midpoint (point of steepest
slope) in the boundary. It works best for samples with small diffusion coefficients
and produces peaks that are proportional to the relative concentration for multiple
components. More information about this function can be found <a href=dcdr.html>here</a>.
