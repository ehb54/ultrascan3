<h2>
Enhanced van Holde - Weischet Data Analysis:</h2>
<p>
The enhanced van Holde - Weischet analysis is a model independent method
to analyze velocity data. It will provide S-value distributions that
are corrected for diffusion effects, and provide valuable diagnostics
for velocity data.  Compared to the traditional van Holde - Weischet
method there are several improvements in the enhanced method which allow
it to better deal with heterogeneous samples and samples that contain
two or more well-separated components. The enhanced method also can take
advantage of data points near the bottom of the cell and from scans that
have no longer a stable plateau or have not yet cleared the meniscus.

<p>
You start the enhanced van Holde - Weischet data analysis by clicking on "<a
href="menu_velocity0.png">Enhanced van Holde - Weischet</a>" in the Velocity
sub-menu of the main menu. The main <a href="vhw-enhanced-1.png">Enhanced van Holde -
Weischet data analysis window</a> will appear.

<p>The first step in the analysis requires that you load an
<b><i>UltraScan</i></b> dataset that has previously been edited with
the <b><i>UltraScan</i></b> editing module. <b><i>UltraScan</i></b>
sedimentation velocity datasets always have the suffix ".us.v". Click
on the "Load Dataset" button in the left upper corner of the control
panel. Simply select the desired run from the selection of available runs
in the <a href="load_sed.png">dataset loading dialog</a>. Once loaded,
the <a href=run_details_veloc.png>Run Details</a> will be shown. Click on
the <b>"Accept"</b> or <b>"Cancel"</b> button, and you will be returned
to the <a href=vhw-enhanced-2.png> analysis window</a>, which will show the first
available dataset of the selected run in the edited data window on the
lower right panel, and the enhanced van Holde - Weischet analysis will be shown
in the upper right panel of the <a href=vhw-enhanced-2.png>analysis window</a>.

Here you can enter the corrections for density, viscosity, and partial
specific volume of your sample. As you change the information in these
fields, the program will automatically update the analysis to correct the
S-value according to the specified buffer conditions. If the data was
retrieved from the database and associated with the correct buffer file
and peptide file, the density, viscosity and partial specific volume (vbar)
will automatically be updated to the appropriate values and don't need to be
adjusted to produce S 20,W corrected values.

<td><img SRC="vhw-enhanced-7.png" ></td>

<td align=justify>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Reset Data </b>- use this button to reset the default settings for the
analysis.</li>
<a name=groups>
<li><b>Select Groups</b> - use this button to define groups of S-value 
intercepts. After clicking on this button you'll see a short 
<a href=vhw-8.png>instruction dialogue</a> asking you to click above
and below a group of lines that intercept close to the same point in 
the extrapolation point. The corrected S-values belonging to these lines
will be averaged and the average value as well as the percentage of the 
total lines (representative of the partial concentration of the component
sedimenting with that S-value) will be displayed in the <a href=vhw-9.png>
plot area</a> and printed to the <a href=vhw_report.txt>data report</a>.
The partial concentrations and S-values from each defined group will also be
written to a model file that can be imported into the finite element 
analysis modules and serve as starting guesses for the finite element fits.

<li>
<b>C(s) Analysis:</b> Clicking on this button will launch the <a
href=cofs.html>C(s) analysis</a> using the currently available limits
from the van Holde - Weischet analysis as an initialization for the C(s)
analysis. The program will add 20% of the range at the top and the bottom
of the current s-value distribution and set the initializations of the
C(s) analysis accordingly.

<li>
<b>2D Spectrum Analysis:</b> Clicking on this button will launch
the <a href=sa2d.html>2-dimensional spectrum analysis</a> using the
currently available limits from the van Holde - Weischet analysis as an
initialization for the spectrum analysis. The program will add 20% of
the range at the top and the bottom of the current s-value distribution
and set the initializations of the spectrum analysis accordingly.

<li>
<a name=backdiff>
<b>Back-Diffusion Tolerance:</b> The back-diffusion tolerance setting controls 
the concentration level at which back-diffusion is considered to be significant.
A small value indicates a small concentration, resulting in a larger 
back-diffusion radius, while a higher tolerance setting results in a smaller
back-diffusion radius, or higher tolerance for back-diffusion effects. This setting
should be adjusted large enough to provide a maximum number of datapoints to be
included in the linear extrapolation fit, but small enough such that the later
scans provide apparent sedimentation coefficients consistent with the earlier
scans. If the later scans yield S-values that are too low, the tolerance is
set to high. Usually the default value is appropriate for standard noise levels in
the data. The back-diffusion boundary is visualized by a red line in the 
<a href=vhw-enhanced-3.png>"Edited Data Plot"</a>
<li>
<b>Divisions: </b>The integral divisions used to create the van Holde -
Weischet extrapolation plot. This is an integral number between 10 and
100. Changing this number will immediately recalculate the van Holde -
Weischet plot and display the plot with the selected number of divisions.
The larger this number, the higher the resolution of the analysis. Generally,
the more datapoints there are across the boundary, the higher this number
can be without introducing excessive noise.</li>

<li>
<b>Data Smoothing:</b> Use this feature to smooth the experimental data.
For noisy data, increasing this parameter can improve the clarity and appearance
of the results considerably. Please note: Whenever possible, especially
for very steep boundaries with low diffusion, try to avoid using too much
smoothing to prevent artificial modification of the boundary shape. Smoothing
is performed based on a frame average. The number shown represents the
size of the smoothing kernel used (the number of datapoints averaged for
a single point). The algorithm used is non-destructive of the original
data and hence the smoothing is reversible. Also, point smoothing is independent,
where the smoothing of one point does not have any effect on the smoothing
of its neighbors. Only unsmoothened points are used for the calculation
of the smoothed value. Each time you click on the counter, the current dataset
will be reset to the full dataset.</li>

<li>
<b>% of Boundary:</b> This is the portion of the boundary used for the
analysis. 100 % refers to the entire boundary, reaching from the baseline
concentration value to the plateau concentration value. This portion is
shown in yellow in the experimental data plot at the lower right panel
of the van Holde - Weischet analysis window. Excluded data is shown in
blue. Changing this number will automatically reset the position of the
analyzable portion of the boundary in the center of concentration between
the baseline and the plateau concentration.</li>

<li>
<b>Boundary Position (%):</b> For percent-boundary values less than
100 %, this number refers to the percentage of total concentration by which
the remainder (=un-analyzed portion of the boundary) is shifted away from
the baseline. A value of 0% refers to a data analysis start at the baseline.
This number is always less than or equal to 100 % - (% of Boundary). It
allows you to control the position of the analyzed portion relative to
the baseline. The blue colored portion of a scan is excluded from the analysis,
and the yellow portion is analyzed.</li>

<li>
<b>Exlude Single Scan:</b> When setting this counter to a non-zero value,
the respective scan will be highlighted in red. Clicking on "Excl. Single
Scan" while a scan is highlighted in red will delete this scan from the
analysis. Deleting scans from the analysis is irreversible and can only
be reset by clicking on the "Reset" button or by reloading the data (when
smoothing, the data is always automatically reloaded, causing the number 
of scans to be reset to the original count). <a href=#skipped>Skipped scans</a>
are excluded automatically. Scans that are selected for exclusion are also
marked with a <a href=vhw-10.png>vertical bar in the analysis plot</a>, so you can 
easily identify which scan is about to be <a href=vhw-11.png>deleted</a>.

<li>
<b>Exclude Scan Range: </b>Same as "<b>Exclude Single Scan</b>", except
for multiple scans. To use this feature, select first the start scan of
the range by using "<b>Exclude Single Scan</b>", then complete the scan
range by using "<b>Exclude Scan Range</b>". Please see the 
<a href="../tutorial/index.html"> van
Holde - Weischet analysis tutorial </a>to decide which scans are appropriate
for analysis and which scans need to be excluded.</li>

<li>
<b>Status: </b>The status bar informs the user about the progress of the
analysis. On slower computers this has more significance than on a fast
Unix machine.</li>
