Genetic Algorithm Control Module</h2>
</center>

<center><img SRC="ga_control1.png"></center>
<p>
In the Genetic Algorithm Control Module you can define the input parameters for 
a genetic algorithm optimization approach. This approach is generally carried out
on a parallel computer cluster, where individual solute "genes" are simulated and
their solutions are compared with the experimental data in the least squares sense
to evaluate their "fitness". Using paradigms from darwinian evolution such as 
mutation, crossover, deletions and insertions, plague and elitism the solute
combinations of the genes to be simulated will evolve over many "generations"
into better fitted solute combinations. To avoid lengthy evolution periods it
helps to initialize the system with known parameters about the system that have been
derived in other, perhaps model-independent approaches, such as the van Holde - Weischet
analysis or other distribution methods implemented in UltraScan.
<p>
The genetic algorithm approach works best for heterogeneous mixtures
of non-interacting solutes that may display a varying degree of
frictional properties which can not be satisfactorily fit by a single
frictional ratio.  This method permits determination of distributions
of sedimentation-, diffusion-, and frictional coefficients, as well as
molecular weight and partial concentration.  More information about this
method can be found in <i>Emre Brookes and Borries Demeler. Genetic Algorithm
Optimization for obtaining accurate Molecular Weight Distributions from
Sedimentation Velocity Experiments. Analytical Ultracentrifugation VIII,
Progr. Colloid Polym. Sci. C. Wandrey, Editor. Springer</i>

<p>
This module assists with the definition of the input parameters into the 
genetic algorithm to prepare a run on a parallel cluster. The steps of the
initializations are:
<p>
<ol>
<li>Loading an initializing s-value distribution
<li>Selecting the number of maximum solutes present in the solution
<li>Either manually or automatically assign individual solute bins
from the distribution to define areas where the genetic algorithm should
search for a solute
<li>Adjust the frictional ratio limits for each solute bin to restrict the 
search space in the frictional domain to a reasonable value. If 2-dimensional
spectrum analysis distributions are used for initialization, the distributions
will also be able to further define the frictional space, otherwise, the 
frictional initialization needs to be done by the user.
<li>Adjusting the genetic algorithm parameters for the evolution operators.

      significantly slow down the convergence process since more solutes need to be

      the optimization is converged.

		This function will attempt to define solute bins based on the integral
		values of the distribution. The algorithm will add 5% at the top and the 
		bottom of the given distribution, and then split the range into the number
		of initial solutes defined above. Instead of equally splitting the s-value
		range, the range is equally spaced into integral values of the distribution
		function, so each bin has approximately the same relative signal.

		Here you can modify the f/f0 ratios for each solute individually. During 
		assignment of each bin, the limits for the f/f0 minimum and maximum of the 
		bin are determined by the setting in the f/f0 min/max counters. If you would
		like to modify the setting, select the appropriate values in the respective 
		counters and double-click on the solute in this listbox to update it's f/f0 
		values with those listed in the counters.

		<b>Distribution Plot</b>
	</td>
	<td>
		Once a distribution is loaded into the plot window, you can either manually
		or automatically assign the bins in which the genetic algorithm will search
		for appropriate parameter values. Using the sedimentation coefficient distribution
		from the van Holde - Weischet analysis, the C(s) analysis, or the 2-dimensional
		spectrum analysis as a guide, you can define bins by first clicking on the left 
		(minimum s-value) and the right (maximum s-value) limit of the bin. You want to
		bracket a peak to define a solute s-value range. You can exceed either the lower
		limit or the upper limit of the distribution to allow for s-values that may have
		not been found in the other analysis methods. Adding too many solute bins will
		significantly slow down the convergence process since more solutes need to be 
		calculated, but it will provide a better chance for a better final solution once
		the optimization is converged.
