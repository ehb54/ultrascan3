This document describes how to fit your equilibrium data to a
global model describing your data by using nonlinear least squares
minimization.  This is handled with the global equilibrium fitting
module of <i><b>UltraScan</i></b>. You can start this module from the
<a href=menu_equilibrium0.png>"Equilibrium" menu</a> under <b>"Global
Fit"</b> or from the <a href=menu_global0.png>Global Fit</a> menu.
Loading this program will display the <a href=global_equil1.png>global
equilibrium control panel</a>. A number of buttons are greyed out,
indicating that those functions are not available at this point in
the fit.

<p>
<b>Importing experimental data:</b>
<p>
First, you need to select appropriate datasets for the fit. For any
global fit, it is necessary that the data in each individual dataset
involves some aspect of the system under investigation which can be
represented globally. Typically, for an equilibrium experiment, this
would be one or more molecular weights, or the association constants
describing the dissociation or association of components, which may be
the same or different (self-association vs. hetero-association). Other
parameters that may be considered global are the partial specific volumes,
which can be determined if the molecular weight of the sample is known
beforehand. Should the molecular weight of the sample be determined, the
partial specific volume of the molecule needs to be known. Those values
can be either determined in an independent measurement, or by estimation
from primary sequence.  Other parameters are considered local, such as
baselines or amplitudes of exponential terms for non-interacting samples.

<p>
To set up the fit, experimental data needs to be imported. This can be
accomplished in one of two ways: First, you can import experimental 
data by loading an <b><i>UltraScan</i></b> equilibrium dataset
that has previously been edited with the <b><i>UltraScan</i></b>
editing module. Second, you can load a previously saved fit, this
method is describe in more detail <a href=#loadfit>below</a>. 

<p>
All <b><i>UltraScan</i></b> sedimentation equilibrium datasets have the
suffix ".us.e". To load edited experimental data, click on the <b>"Load
Data"</b> button in the left upper corner of the control panel. Simply
select the desired run from the selection of available runs in the <a
href="load_sed_equil.png">dataset loading dialog</a>. Once loaded, the
<a href=run_details_equil.png>Run Details</a> will be shown. Click on
the <b>"Accept"</b> or <b>"Cancel"</b> button, and you will be returned
to the main analysis window, now with the first dataset loaded, and the
first scan <a href=global_equil2.png>displayed</a> in the plot area.
For information on how to edit equilibrium data, please check <a
href=edit_equil_abs.html>here</a>.

<p>
The global equilibrium fitting program considers equilibrium fits as
"Projects", which can consist out of more than one experimental dataset,
or out of several combined datasets. There is no program limit to the
number of datascans that can be imported. You can import several edited
runs, which in themselves consist of multiple scans. The datasets do
not have to be (and should not be) all at the same speed, temperature,
concentration, or wavelength, since a variation in those parameters
improves the signal spectrum for the fit. Moreover, these parameters
can be adjusted and compensated for individually.  (Please check the
<a href=../tutorial/equil_tutorial.html>Global Nonlinear Least Squares
Equilibrium Tutorial</a> for details on how to design good experiments
and select appropriate data).

<p>
After loading one or more datasets, several buttons will become <a
href=global_equil2.png>activated</a> and you will be able to perform additional
functions. The first scan will be displayed in the plot area, and the
descriptions of the available scans from the selected run will be shown in
the <a href=global_equil4.png>listbox</a> for all available equilibrium scans.

<p>
Loading data activates the following additional functions:
<p>
<ol>
<li><b>Unload all Data</b> - this function allows you to unload all presently
loaded scans. All additional functions will be disabled again.
<p>
<li><b>Run Details</b> - this function allows you to review
the run details of each run. When you select this function, an <a
href=global_equil3.png>equilibrium run manager dialog</a> will be shown
that displays all available equilibrium runs. Select the desired run by
double clicking on the filename. The <a href=run_details_equil.png>Run
Details window</a> will open up and display all details for the selected
run.

<p>
<li><b>Print</b> - this functions allows you to print the scan currently
displayed in the plot window to a printer or postscript file. You can select
different scans to be displayed in the plot area by clicking on the desired
scan in the <a href=global_equil4.png>scan information listbox</a> or by 
selecting the scan with the <a href=global_equil6.png>scan selector</a> 
counter from the <a href=global_equil5.png>model window</a>.
<p>
<li><b>Select Model</b> - now that data has been loaded, a model can be 
selected for global nonlinear least squares fitting. This is discussed
in the <a href=equil2.html>next section</a>.
</ul>
<p>
<a name=loadfit>
The second way of importing data is to load a fit from a previous 
fitting session. This is accomplished by clicking on the <b>"Load Fit"</b>
button. All settings from the previous fit will then be restored in a complete
memory copy of the memory state when the fit was saved. It will restore
all scan limits, fitting parameters, run parameters and all scans and
their settings from the point where they were saved. The data can then 
be used for further refinement or to change to a different model. Each step
is explained in the following documents.
<p>
<b>Naming the Project:</b>
<p>
Each fit is considered a project, which may consist out of more than one
equilibrium run. In order to avoid naming conflicts, the name of the project
should be different than the name of the run. Descriptive project names are
recommended, however, spaces in the project name should be avoided. You should 
rename your project from the default "SampleFit" to something that you can
remember by entering a new name in the <a href=global_equil7.png>"Project Name:"</a>
field.
<p>
<b>Selecting a Maximum Optical Density</b>
<p>
Absorbance scans will suffer from nonlinearity above a certain optical density.
Therefore it is prudent to only consider data within an absorbance range that
has been verified to produce linear results. These limits may be different 
for different wavelength. Check your instrument to determine within which
range your data is reliable. You can change the absorption cutoff limit by 
entering it into the <a href=global_equil8.png>Max. OD/Fringe:</a> field. A value of
zero inactivates automatic high concentration limits, however, you will be 
able to manually adjust limits on each scan (discussed in <a href=equil3.html>
Section 3</a>). The default setting for this parameter is 0.9 OD.
