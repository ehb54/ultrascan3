After initializing the parameters for the fit, you should either manually
select parameters to be floated by selecting the "Float" checkbox
for each parameter you want to be floated, or click on the <b>"Float
Parameters"</b> button, which will automatically set all applicable
parameters to be floated. A <a href=global_equil30.png> message window</a>
will pop up to inform you which parameters have been set to be floated.
After clicking on <b>"Float Parameters"</b>, the <b>"Check Scans for
Fit"</b> button will be activated, and can be used to perform a test,
which will confirm that the fit is properly initialized.

<p>
In this test, the following properties will be checked to...
<p>
<ol>
<li>Indicate if the molecular weight or the partial specific volume for 
a given parameters is floated
<li>Enough scans for a global fit are included (2 minimum are required for a 
global fit)
<li>make sure that appropriate parameters are floated
<li>Indicate if the partial specific volume has been adjusted or left at 
the default value of 0.72 ccm/g
<li>Indicate if the buffer density corresponds to the density of pure water
<li>For each scan, indicate if the scan is included or excluded from the fit
</ol>
<p>
Once the test has completed, an <a href=global_equil31.png>information
window</a> will be opened which will display the test results. The
test results can also be printed, and will be saved to a file
called "<a href=scan_check.txt>scan_check.res</a>", which will
be saved in your results directory, as configured with the <a
href=config.html>configuration module</a>.

<p>
After reviewing the test results, you can proceed to the fitting session
by clicking on the <b>"Fitting Control"</b> button, which is now activated.
This will invoke the <a href=nls1.png>fitting control window</a>.
Clicking on the "Fit" button in the fitting control window will start
the nonlinear least squares fitting process. Details of this process
are explained <a href=nls.html>elsewhere</a>. After fitting has completed,
the <a href=global_equil33.png>overlays</a> or 
<a href=global_equil32.png>residuals</a> will be displayed in the plot window
and the result file can be displayed or printed out, by clicking on
"View Report" in the <a href=global_equil35.png>fitting control window</a>.

<p>
The data analysis report consists out of two sections: 
<p>
<ol>
<li><b>Global Parameter Section:</b>
<p>
In the global parameter section, the global run parameters and fitting
results will be displayed. Below is an example:

Expected Number of Runs:      2134 (corrected)
Run Variance:                 1.067e+03 (corrected)

According to these statistical tests, this model is an acceptable candidate for the experimental data.
This fit can be used for a Monte Carlo Analysis with reservations.
</pre>
<p>
The analysis results include a qualitative test of the fitting statistics.
"Runs" are a measure for the presence of systematic noise. The presence of
systematic noise may indicate that the model is inappropriate for the fit.
Models with a large percentage of runs (35 % or better) and a low variance
are considered better fits than models with a higher variance and a lower
percentage of runs. According to the number of runs in the fit, recommendations
are provided concerning the appropriateness of analyzing the model and data
with the <a href=monte_carlo.html>Monte Carlo Analysis</a>, which can 
provide reliable statistics for the fit.
<p>
<li><b>Local Parameter Section:</b>
<p>
For each scan, individual fitting results and statistics are shown. Excluded
scans are indicated. Besides the static parameters for each scan, amplitude,
baseline, buoyancy, extinction coefficients and density settings are shown.
Integrals corresponding to the relative concentration of the component(s) 
in the sample are calculated. These integrals are based on the area under
the modelled curve between the meniscus (as defined in the editing of the
equilibrium run) and the bottom of the cell (as defined by the centerpiece
geometry and the rotor stretching, which is calculated based on the rotor
selection used in the editing program).
Individual fitting statistics are also shown:

Should you decide to perform a <a href=monte_carlo.html>Monte Carlo
analysis</a> on your fit, you will need to first save the fit by clicking
on the "Save Fit" button in the <a href=global_equil35.png>fitting control
window</a>.  Next, you can click on the <b>"Monte Carlo"</b> button in the
<a href=global_equil36.png>Model and Fitting Information</a> section of
the Global Equilibrium Fitting Window</a>. More information on the Monte
Carlo analysis is available <a href=monte_carlo.html> here</a>, a <a
href=monte_carlo_tutorial.html>Monte Carlo tutorial</a> is also available.
