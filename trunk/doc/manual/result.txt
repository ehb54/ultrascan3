Molecular Weight Calculation for Sequence "lysozyme.seq":

Description:  pgr1n.pk002.n14 Normalized Chicken Reproductive Tract cDNA Library

Molecular Weight: 369265 Dalton (630 basepairs)

Number of Adenine Residues: 120
Number of Cytosin Residues: 125
Number of Guanine Residues: 177
Number of Thymine Residues: 208
Number of Uracil Residues: 0

The molecular weight was calculated with the following molar ratios
of counterions:

Sodium:    0.00 mols/residue
Potassium: 0.00 mols/residue
Lithium:   0.00 mols/residue
Magnesium: 0.00 mols/residue
Calcium:   0.00 mols/residue

The 3'-terminus was calculated as a hydroxyl group.
The 5'-terminus was calculated as a phosphate group.
The molecular weight represents a double-stranded molecule.
