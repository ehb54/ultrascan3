      Customizing and generating Publication-Quality Graphs of all UltraScan
      Plots:
    </h2>
    <p>
      The QWT C++ plotting library, on which <i><b>UltraScan</b></i> is
      based, and which is distributed with <i><b>UltraScan</b></i>, provides
      a powerful feature for editing all plot properties such as line and
      symbol type, color, size, etc. as well as plot layout, title and label
      fonts, and the axis properties. To invoke the plot configuration for
      any plot generated under <i><b>UltraScan</b></i>, simply right-click on
      the plot frame. This will open up the main plot customization panel:
    </p>
    <center>
      <img src="custom_plot1.png">
    </center>
    <p>
      In the window entitled <b>"Title Elements"</b> you can modify the text
      of the plot title and change the font using the <a href=
      "usfont-2.png">font selection panel</a>. The next window is entitled
      <b>"Curve Elements"</b> and will list all curves displayed in the
      current plot. The curves are displayed by their name and number of
      appearance in the plot. You can simply click on the curve you want to
      change or select multipl curves (if multiple curves are displayed) to
      change all to the same properties. After selecting the desired curves,
      click on <b>"Update Selected Curve..."</b> to change the curve(s)
      properties. You will then be presented with the curve property control
      panel:
    </p>
    <center>
      <img src="custom_plot2.png">
    </center>
    <p>
      Select the desired curve properties from the drop-down lists, which
      include several predefined options, as well as the <b>"Customize"</b>
      option, which lets you set custom selections for colors. You can also
      edit the curve's description. Please not that different curves may have
      the same description, which may be best avoided to prevent confusion.
    </p>
    <p>
      Last, you can modify the plot elements such as background color,
      margin, legend position and font, as well as axis properties. The axis
      properties are shown in the axis control panel:
