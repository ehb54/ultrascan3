After selecting a model, the <b>"Scan Diagnostics"</b> button will be
activated.  This function will apply a series of tests prior to fitting
to determine which of the available scans are suitable for inclusion in
the fit. You have to execute this function before proceeding to the 
next functio. The following tests will be employed:

<p>
<ol>
<li><b>Slope Check:</b> This test will measure the slope at the beginning
and the end of the scan. It will then calculate a ratio of the slope at
the end over the slope at the beginning of the scan. If the ratio is too
small, a warning will be produced. If the ratio is too small, check for
aggregation, or a speed that is too slow for the experiment. In addition,
warnings will be produced if either slope is negative. This is usually
a sign of excessive noise at the ends of the scan. Further editing will
probably be required (see <a href=equil4.html>next section</a> for more
information on how to edit scans in the control panel).
<p>
<li><b>Point Number Check:</b> If the number of datapoints in this scan
is below 50, a warning is issued. Check to make sure that the smallest
datapoint increment was used in the Beckman Data Acquisition software
to make sure sufficient datapoints have been collected. Also, make sure
that the column was at least 3 mm in height.
<p>
<li><b>OD Range:</b> The XLA allows you to collect data between zero
and one OD and higher. For most wavelengths the Xenon flashlamp of
the XLA produces sufficient intensity to obtain a linear response up
to 0.9-1.0 OD. Above this optical density you probably reach into a
nonlinear range. Therefore, it is prudent to at least have exploited
all data in that absorbance range. If the total range is below 0.9 OD,
a warning is issued. Check for aggregation, slow rotor speed or improper
scan cropping/editing.

</ol>
<p>
If three or more warnings were generated, the scan will be
marked with a blue triangle (<img src=bluearrow.png>) in the
<a href=global_equil16.png>Scan Listbox</a> and automatically
excluded from the fit. After reviewing the reason for the exclusion
and assigning initial parameter estimates, you can override the
exclusion by double-clicking on the scan in the scan listbox. In
that case, the scan will be labeled with a red triangle (<img
src=redarrow.png>) to indicate manual selection of this scan. Scans
that were found acceptable for inclusion into the fit will be marked
with a green triangle (<img src=greenarrow.png>). These warnings
are for your information only, they have no effect on the rest of
the program since there are valid exceptions to these warnings when
including such scans in a fit is appropriate. Please refer to the
<a href=../tutorial/equil_tutorial.html>global equilibrium analysis
tutorial</a> for more information.

<p>
After the scan check a <a href=global_equil15.png> listing</a>
identifying any problems found will be generated and displayed
in an <a href=global_equil15.png>information window</a>. If any
warnings were generated, a <a href=global_equil14.png>note</a> will
be printed on the screen.  All collected information will also be
written to a file in the <b><i>UltraScan</b></i> root directory, called
"diagnostics.res". This file can also be printed from the file menu of
the <a href=global_equil15.png>information window</a>.

<p>
After the scan diagnostics have completed, and all scans have been assigned
as either included (green arrow) or excluded (blue arrow), the Concentration
Histogram button will be activated. Clicking on this button will generate
a <a href=global_equil17.png>concentration histogram</a> of all 
<i>included</i> scans. The program will sample each datapoint of each 
included scan and count the frequency of occurence for each concentration.
The program will subdivide the concentration range defined by the lowest
and highest concentration occuring in any included scan into fifty 
equally spaced bins and plot the frequencies of each bin.
<p>
The purpose for this plot is to provide a qualitative idea of the 
signal strength for each concentration present in the fit. Since 
self-associating models depend on a concentration range which leads to
the presence of multiple species, the signal provided by each species
is hence directly correlated to the concentration. If you have a 
self-associating system present, the signal strength ideally should
be equally represented for each concentration/species. If the data includes
data taken at multiple wavelengts, a <a href=global_equil18.png>warning</a>
will be printed to alert you that you should correct the extinction coefficients
for each wavelength so that all concentrations can be displayed, and corrected for 
differences in absorptivity. In that case, only a histogram of the optical
densities is possible. This can be handled in the <a href=global_equil5.png>
model control</a> module which is described in more detail <a href=equil5.html>
here</a>.
