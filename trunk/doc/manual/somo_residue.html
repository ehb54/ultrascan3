<p>
In this module is used to define all residues that can be found in PDB files. 
In this module, you also can define the 
rules which used to convert them into beads. You can add new residues or
modify the properties of the existing ones. Three panels are available:
<p>
<ol>
<li> <b>Define Residue Properties</b>
<li> <b>Define Residue Atoms</b>
<li> <b>Define Residue Bead Properties</b>
</ol>

<p>
<b>Panel 1: Define Residue Properties:</b>
<p>
<table BORDER CELLSPACING=5 CELLPADDING=5>
<tr>
<td align=center><img SRC="somo-residue-0.png" ALT="Define Residue Properties"></td>

<tr>

<p>In this panel, you can add or modify the general properties of a residue.
To add a new residue, you must first load the <a href="somo-2.png">atom table</a>
containing the atomic groups, as defined in the PDB file (N, CA, CB, etc.),
that make up the residue. <br>The residue name (ALA, GLY, PRO, etc.) is entered
in the <i>Residue Name</i> field, and the <i>Number of Atoms in Residue</i>
field is then completed (note that only non-hydrogen atoms have to be counted;
for NMR-derived models, hydrogen atoms fields are discarded by the SOMO PDB
parser). <br>The next field, <i>Number of Beads for Residue</i>, defines how many
beads will be used to represent the residue. For amino acids or nucleic acid
bases, we suggest to use a bead for the main-chain and another for the side-chain
segments. For carbohydrates, a bead per residue will usually suffice.
<br>The <i>Residue Type</i> field is then defined from the pull-down list,
presently including:
<p>
<ul>
<li>Amino Acid
<li>Sugar Moiety
<li>Nucleotide
<li>Heme
<li>Phosphate
<li>Co-factor
</ul
<p>
The <i>Residue anhydrous mol. vol. (A^3)</i> field has to be filled with a
value usually derived from crystallography (see Tsai et al., J. Mol. Biol.
290:253-266, 1999). This is the volume that defines the total anhydrous volume
of the bead(s) that will be used to model the residue.
<br>In contrast, the <i>Residue partial spec. vol. (cm^3/g)</i> field pertains to
the solution partial specific volume (psv) of the residue (in water @ 20°C),
and is used to compute the global psv of the model, necessary to determine
the sedimentation coefficient from the translational frictional coefficient.
<br>Finally, the <i>Max. Accessible Surface Area (A^2)</i> field is entered. It is
used for control purposes only, to calculate the percentage accessible surface
area (ASA) of each residue with respect to this theoretical maximum value.

<p>When all fields have been filled, the residue is accepted by pressing the
<b>Accept Residue and Continue</b> button, and the <i>Number of Residues in File
</i> field is consequently updated.

<b>Panel 2: Define Residue Atoms:</b>
<p>
<table BORDER CELLSPACING=5 CELLPADDING=5>

<td align=center><img SRC="somo-residue-1.png" ALT="Define Residue Atoms"></td>

<p>In this panel, the atoms making up the residue are chosen, using the
<a href="somo-2.png">atom table</a> previously selected. The atoms are numbered
sequentially up to the value entered in the <i>Number of Atoms in Residue</i>
field in the previous panel, and can be chosen from the <i>Select Residue Atom
 to be defined</i> pull-down menu.
<br>An atom type is then selected from the pull-down menu in the
<i>Select Atom from Lookup Table</i> menu, and an available hybridization
is then chosen from the <i>Select Hybridization for Atom</i> pull-down menu 
below it. <br>If the current atom will contribute to the definition of the
position of the bead to which it will be assigned (next panel), the
<i>Atom determines Position</i> checkbox must be selected.
<br>The <b>Assign Current Atom</b> button is then clicked, and the <i>Select 
Residue Atom to be defined</i> field is then updated.
<br>This operation is repeated until all atoms in the residue have been assigned,
and the <b>Continue</b> button can then be pressed.

<b>Panel 3: Define Residue Bead Properties:</b>
<p>
<table BORDER CELLSPACING=5 CELLPADDING=5>

<td align=center><img SRC="somo-residue-2.png" ALT="Define Residue Bead Properties"></td>

<p>In the last panel of this module, the atoms in each residue are assigned
to bead(s), and their properties are then defined.
<br>According to the value entered in the <i>Number of Beads for Residue</i>
field in Panel 1, the <i>Select Residue Bead to be defined</i> pull-down menu
will allow to select a bead from the list. All subsequent operations will affect
the selected bead only.
<br>First a color is assigned to the bead using the <i>Select Bead Color</i>
pull-down menu. Be aware that two colors are presently reserved to "label"
the beads so that they can be automatically excluded from the hydrodynamic
computations, colors "0" (black) and "6" (brown), so they should NOT be used.
In the <a href="somo-residue-0.png">residue table</a> (somo.residue) provided
with the UltraScan distribution, the colors are assigned so to label the beads as:
<p>
<ol>
<li>- Blue: protein main-chain
<li>- Green: protein acidic side-chain (D,E)
<li>- Cyan: protein hydrophobic side-chain (A,V,L,I,F,W)
<li>- Red: protein polar side-chain (H,Y,S,T,N,Q)
<li>- Magenta: protein non-polar side-chain (C,M,P)
<li>- Brown: RESERVED for buried beads
<li>- White: unassigned
<li>- Grey: unassigned
<li>- Light Blue: unassigned
<li>- Light Green: unassigned
<li>- Light Cyan: unassigned
<li>- Light Red: unassigned
<li>- Light Magenta: unassigned
<li>- Yellow: protein basic side-chain (K,R)
<li>- Bright White: unassigned
</ol>
<p> 
The next field, <i>Hydration Number for Bead</i>, assigns a
theoretical number of water of hydration molecules to the bead, which is defined
for each residue side- and main-chain based on the values reported by
Kuntz and Kauzmann (Adv. Protein Chem. 28:239-345, 1974; for further
information, see Rai et al., Structure 13:723-734, 2005). The volume of 
these water molecule(s) (defined under the <b>Miscellaneous Options</b>;
see <a href=somo_misc.html>here</a>) will be later added to the anhydrous
volume of the bead to define its hydrated volume and radius.
<br>Next comes the <i>Select Positioning Method</i> field, offering three
options:
<p><i>Center of gravity</i>: between the atoms assigned to the bead and marked
"yes" in the <i>Atom determines Position</i> checkbox in Panel 2;
<br><i>Farthest atom</i>: from the center of gravity of the molecule, again
between the atoms assigned to the bead and marked "yes" in the
<i>Atom determines Position</i> checkbox in Panel 2;
<br><i>No positioning</i>: to exclude the bead from the model.
<p>Currently, only the "Center of gravity" option is being used.
<p>Each bead needs then to be defined as belonging to the <i>backbone</i>
or to the <i>sidechain</i> of the molecule by clicking the appropriate box
in the <i>This Bead is part of the:</i> field.
<br>The <i>Bead Volume</i> field defines the anhydrous volume (in A^3) assigned
to the bead. IMPORTANT: the sum of the volumes of the bead(s) defining a residue
MUST match the <i>Residue anhydrous mol. vol.</i> entered in Panel 1. The
program will NOT let you save the residue/bead definition if there is a
discrepancy between these two values. The values present in the current
definitions of the amino acid residues were derived from the crystallographic
analysis of Tsai et al. (J. Mol. Biol. 290:253-266, 1999).
<br>The next two fields, <i>Bead Mol. Weight</i> and <i> Bead hydrated Volume,
        Radius</i> are for visualization only, and will display respectively the
bead molecular weight, calculated from the values (taken from the <a href=
"somo-2.png">atom table</a>) of the atoms assigned to the bead, and its hydrated
molecular volume and hydrated radius (derived by summing to the anhydrous 
<i>Bead Volume</i> the volume of the water of hydration molecules). These two
fields will display the values when the <b>Accept Bead Definition</b> button is
pressed (see below).
<br>The last step is the assignment of atoms to the bead. In the <i>Select Atom
for Bead (multi-selection OK)</i> window, you can see the list of all the atoms
that belong to the residue, as defined previously in Panel 2. By clicking on
an atom, it will be also displayed in the <i>Currently defined Atoms for Bead</i>
window to the left. Once all atoms belongin to a bead have been selected, the
bead is accepted by clicking on the <b>Accept Bead Definition</b> button.
<br>If the residue is represented by more than one bead, the process is repeated
until all beads have been processed. The residue can then be added to the file
by clicking on the <b>Add Residue to File</b> button. The process can be
interrupted at any stage by pressning the <b>Reset</b> button.

<p>To Edit an already defined residue, double-click on its name on the list
(that can be scrolled) present in the window next to the <i>Number of residues in
File</i> field in Panel 1. All the stored properties will then appear
first in the Panel 1 fields, which can then be updated. By clicking on the
<b>Accept Residue and Continue</b> button, the properties listed in Panel 2
become then accessible, and can be likewise edited. Finally, the Panel 3
options will become again available for editing by clicking on the
<b>Assign Current Atom</b> button in Panel 2. <b>Accept Bead Definition</b>
and <b>Add Residue to File</b> buttoms will then allow to update the
<a href="somo-residue-0.png">residue table</a> (somo.residue).
<br>A selected residue/bead definition can be also removed from the file by
clicking on the <b>Delete Residue</b> button.
<br>Pressing <b>Close</b> will then exit from the <b>Modify Residue Lookup 
Tables</b> menu and return the operator to the <b>Main menu</b>.
