    <h2> How to Convert Ultracentrifuge Raw Data to UltraScan III AUC Format </h2>

    <p> With us_convert, you can import and convert experimental raw
    data, acquired using an ultracentrifuge, into a set of files
    written in the UltraScan III OpenAUC format. An AUC file is
    a binary file that contains all the information from a single
    dataset (cell/channel/wavelength combination, also called a
    <i>triple</i>) imported and converted from the original raw data
    format.  So if the raw experimental run contained data in three
    channels us_convert would convert that into three binary AUC
    files, which can then be uploaded to an UltraScan III database
    and prepared for analysis. The AUC file format is described <a
    href='http://wiki.bcf2.uthscsa.edu/ultrascan3/wiki/Us3Formats'>here</a>.
    </p>

    alt="US_Convert Window"/></p>

    <p> Using this window, you can convert raw data located on your local
    disk, and then store the resulting AUC file(s) on your local disk
    or in the current database. You can save the information on local
    disk and then synchronize your data with the database later if you
    prefer. You must be identified as the investigator (or data owner)
    to delete or update a converted AUC file in the database.</p>

    <p>The first step is to select either the Database or the Local Disk
    radio button at the top of the window. This indicates your primary
    data repository at the moment. Many buttons are affected by this---
    loading and saving data, including support information like buffers and
    projects, will look at these radio buttons to determine where to
    perform their tasks. You may switch back and forth as you work,
    for instance loading solutions from database and then saving them
    to disk so that they will be available later when you are not connected
    to the Internet.</p>

    <h3>STEP 1: Loading Data</h3>

    <p>To load data into the application, do one of the following:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><b>Importing Experimental Data</b>. Click on the &quot;Import XLA/I/F
      Data from HD.&quot; Locate the raw data on your local disk, and
      highlight the directory that contains the files. This procedure
      is the same no matter which type of ultracentrifuge data was acquired.
      Us_convert will convert the data and display it in the window.</li>

      <li><b>Importing MWL Data</b>. Click on the &quot;Import MWL Data from
      HD.&quot; Locate the raw multi-waveLength data on your local disk, and
      highlight the directory that contains the files. This program will convert
      the MWL data and display it in the window.</li>

      <li><b>Loading US3 Data</b>. You can load data that has already been
      converted and stored in the UltraScan III OpenAUC format, either from disk
      or database, by clicking on the &quot;Load US3 OpenAUC Data&quot; button.
      This program will display the data so that you can edit it further or
      synchronize data between disk and database.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>STEP 2: Editing the run information</h3>

    <p>Click on the &quot;Edit Run Information&quot; button to open a
    <a href='convert-experiment.html'>Managing Experiment Information</a>
    dialog.</p>

    <p>You can view some of the details by clicking on the
    &quot;Run Details&quot; button.</p>

    <h3>STEP 3: Verifying the RunID</h3>

    <p>The runID must be a unique string of characters. Normally it is the 
    directory name from which the raw data was loaded and converted, but if 
    you re-import the data you will encounter a naming conflict in the database,
    because another run by the same name already exists in the database.
    To avoid this, go to the edit box labeled &quot;Run ID:&quot; and change
    the name to a name that is unique in the database. You should make this
    this name change first, since this edit box will be disabled in the next step.
    </p>

    <h3>STEP 4: Cell/Channel/Wavelength Triples</h3>

    <p>The different cell/channel/wavelength (c/c/w) combinations will
    appear in the listbox to the left. You may click on each of these to see
    the data from that c/c/w. First, select the centerpiece that was used
    from the drop-down list. Then create or select a solution for each c/c/w 
    in the data. Click on the button labeled &quot;Manage Solution&quot;
    to associate a solution for the currently selected c/c/w, by opening a 
    <a href='us_solution.html'>Manage Solution Information</a> dialog.
    You may wish to use the &quot;Apply to All&quot; button to copy solution
    information from the currently-selected c/c/w to all the others.
    You could then select exceptions and associate a different solution for
    that c/c/w if you wish. Click on the &quot;Show Intensity Profile&quot;
    button to see the intensity profile if you wish.</p>

    <p>Note that for Multi-wavelength (MWL) data, the contents of the
    left-side listbox is actually cell/channel entries, with wavelengths
    represented as a range of wavelengths and with a count of wavelengths shown
    in parentheses. The MWL special elements are detailed below.</p>

    <h3>STEP 5: Handling Special Cases</h3>

    <p>Depending on the type of data being converted, additional processing 
    may be required. In the following paragraphs we describe
    how to process these types of data, followed by a snapshot.</p>

    <p><b>Radial Intensity Data (Beckman suffix &quot;RI&quot;).</b>
    First, select the c/c/w that you wish to be defined as the
    reference. Then click on the button labeled &quot;Define Reference
    Scans&quot; and control-click the range you wish to use in the
    plot. That is, hold the control button down on the keyboard while
    clicking the left mouse button. Control-click on two points in the
    radial range that corresponds to a clean, noise free region in which
    the reference data can be found. This is typically the air region
    above the meniscus, but it can also be a channel that contains air or
    water.  The program will use the reference data to convert the radial
    intensity data to pseudo absorbance data. Next, you can click on
    &quot;Drop Current c/c/w&quot; for each of the reference channels you
    don&rsquo;t need any more, or you can click on &quot;Undo Reference
    Scans&quot; to undo the reference scan processing and do it again.</p>

    <p class='center'><img src="images/convert-RIdata.png" 
    alt="Converting RI data to pseudo-absorbance data"/></p>

    <p><b>Multiple channels.</b> In cases where you used a 6 or 8
    channel centerpiece, you will have multiple channels in a single
    channel, which need to be separated into individual c/c/w triples.
    You can define subset c/c/w combinations by clicking on the button
    labeled &quot;Define Subsets&quot; and then control-click at the
    radius that separates columns. Do not click at the the starting and
    ending radius for the entire dataset---these are assumed. When you
    are finished, click on the &quot;Process Subsets&quot; button and
    the c/c/w combinations will be separated out. You will need to do
    this for each of the original datasets in the data.</p>

    <p class='center'><img src="images/convert-subset.png" alt="Processing
    Subsets in RA Data"/></p>

    <p><b>Wavelength Data.</b> In wavelength data the datasets are separated
    by radius instead of wavelength, and so we have c/c/r combinations.
    In order to separate the datasets into wavelength data, the tolerance
    level between datasets has to be adjusted to a smaller number. Us_convert
    chooses 0.1 cm as the separation tolerance for wavelength data, however
    you might decide that you would like to use a different number. If so,
    you can adjust the tolerance in the &quot;Dataset Separation Tolerance&quot;
    box, above. As you change it the c/c/r combinations will adjust
    dynamically.</p>

    <p class='center'><img src="images/convert-tolerance.png" 
    alt="Adjusting Tolerance Between Datasets"/></p>

    <p><b>MWL Data.</b> In multi-wavelength data, there are many triples.
    But selection is generally done by chosing a cell/channel and then
    adjusting the range of wavelengths within that channel.
    Some of the additional GUI elements and their corresponding options for
    MWL include the following.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><b>&lambda; Start:</b> For the currently selected cell/channel,
      you may adjust the start of the wavelength range.</li>

      <li><b>&lambda; End:</b> For the currently selected cell/channel,
      you may adjust the end of the wavelength range.</li>

      <li><b>Plot &lambda;:</b> You may select the wavelength for which to
      plot AUC data. Alternatively, you may use the <b>previous</b> or
      <b>next</b> button to change the wavelength by one in either direction.
      </li>

      <li>(left-arrow icon)<b>previous</b> Click on this button to select the
      next lower wavelength in the cell/channel for display.</li>

      <li>(right-arrow icon)<b>next</b> Click on this button to select the
      next higher wavelength in the cell/channel for display.</li>

    <p class='center'><img src="images/convert-mwl.png" 
    alt="Convert MWL Data"/></p>

    <h3>STEP 5: Dropping Triples</h3>

    <p>Click on the &quot;Drop Selected Triples&quot; button to open a
    <a href='convert-seltrip.html'>Select Triples for Delete</a> dialog.
    This may be used to exclude entire triples from further processing.
    The action is particularly useful for MWL data, where some channels
    may be really only used as reference scans, or some triples are in
    wavelength ranges where there is insufficient light, excessive or too
    little absorbance, or the channel may have leaked. After reference
    scans are defined, all of the triples for these channels may be
    dropped. Whether the data is MWL or not, intensity or not; it may be
    useful to drop selected triples whose data is problematic. Dropping
    useless triples is recommended since it will reduce the dataset size
    and speed up downstream processing</p>

    <h3>Other Notes</h3>
    <h3>STEP 6: Saving Your Data</h3>

    <p>Click on the &quot;Save&quot; button to save the data, either to
    local disk or to the database. In some cases the save button will
    be disabled. This means that you haven&rsquo;t completed all the
    tasks above. Double-check each of those items and try again.
    The &quot;Instructions (to do list)&quot; lists all actions still
    in need of being done before the data can be saved. Review this list
    to find out what actions still need to be performed. Only when this
    list is empty will the &quot;Save&quot; button be enabled.</p>

    <h3>Other Notes</h3>

    <p><b>Scan Controls.</b> The scan controls allow you to highlight
    individual or groups of scans in a different color. This can be
    useful for counting scans or identifying how many scans may be
    baseline scans.  While you cannot exclude individual scans from
    your data at this step, you can either remove selected scan files
    before importing into UltraScan III (the order does not matter)
    or you can mark selected scans or scan ranges for exclusion during
    the editing process.</p>

    <p><b>Reset Button.</b> The reset button erases all data so that
    you can start over. Use this button every time before you process
    another dataset after having processed one already.</p>

    <p><b>Help Button.</b> Displays this help text.</p>

    <p><b>Description Field.</b>You can change the description of this
    run here. This is helpful especially for intensity data acquired on the XLA
    where only one line is available for each cell, and both channels are described
    by the same line in the Beckman data acquisition program. After importing both
    channels from an intensity experiment into UltraScan III, you can assign 
    a different description to each channel in this field.</p>

    <p><b>Order of steps.</b> It is not generally necessary to perform
    the steps in order. For instance, step two is where you connect your
    newly-acquired data to your database profile, so if you are not
    connected to the database you cannot complete this step. However,
    sticking to the sequence in general may help you to remember to
    do them all. For MWL data it is best to &quot;Define Reference
    Scans&quot; early in the sequence, before any &quot;Drop Selected
    Triples&quot; or other actions.</p>
