    <h2> <i>UltraScan</i> Data Loader: </h2>

    <p> A number of <b><i>UltraScan III</i></b> applications load edited
    experiment data for processing. These applications use the US_DataLoader
    dialog class to allow the user to choose the data.</p>

    <p> The dialog presented when a US_DataLoader is executed allows a
    list of edited data choices from database or local disk. A Search text
    field allows the list to be pared down to those of interest. After a data
    set is selected in the list, a Load button passes experiment data to the
    caller.</p>

              that enables you to browse potential database investigators
              and select one. This button is disabled for normal non-privileged

              consist of matching entries. A blank field restores the full
              list. Note that the search is case-insensitive.

              transformed. If a Run is selected, only that run with its
              triple and edit descendants will be shown.

    <h3> Data Set Selection </h3>

    <p> Most often, you need not expand the list tree and need only select
    the top level run ID description. This effectively selects all triples
    for the run and selects the first listed edit for each triple. In the
    default case where Latest Data Edit was checked in the calling dialog,
    there will be only one edit (the latest) for each triple. If Latest
    Data Edit was not checked, there may be multiple edits for triples. In
    this case, selecting a Run description or a Triple description effectively
    selects the earliest edit(s).</p>

    <p> You may, of course, select specific triples of a run.</p>

    <p> Similarly, in the case where Lastest Data Edit was not checked, you
    may select any edit of a triple.</p>

    <p> Note that multiple selections must all be from the same run. Only one
    selection is allowed for each triple.</p>
