    <h2> <i>UltraScan</i> Time Derivative (dC/dt) Data Analysis: </h2>

    <p> The DCDT or Time Derivative method will calculate g(S) differential
    sedimentation profiles by subtracting consecutive scan pairs from each
    other and mapping the resulting difference curves to the S domain to
    obtain dcdt curves. The advantage of this method is its ability to nicely
    subtract out time invariant noise, such as window scratches and dirt,
    as well as refractive index hetereogeneities in the windows. The latter
    is particularly important for low-concentration interference data. Unlike
    the <a href=vhw_enhanced.html>van Holde - Weischet method</a>, the Time
    Derivative method does not correct for diffusion. In order to obtain
    accurate results with this method, it is important that you use only a
    small scan range over which diffusion has not changed significantly.</p>
