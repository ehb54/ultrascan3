    <h2> <i>UltraScan</i> vHW Distribution Plot: </h2>

    <p> In the van Holde - Weischet (vHW) Enhanced program, there is a Distribution Plot
    option that brings up a dialog in which the vHW analysis data is displayed
    as a distribution plot or a histogram plot. In either case, a clustering of data
    around several sedimentation coefficient points indicates the presence of
    multiple species in the solution.</p>
