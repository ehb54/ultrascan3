    <h2> Manage Data Tree View Context Menus:</h2>

    <p> One of the main purposes of the Manage Data application is to bring
    each data set in the database and on local disk into synchronization.
    The processes to accomplish this are accessible through a context menu
    that pops up when you right-mouse-button click on a tree row. You can
    then move the cursor until a desired process is highlighted and release
    the mouse button to initiate that process.<p>

    <p> There is no "Synchronize" option. The best method to accomplish
    identical records in the database and locally is something you must
    decide for each individual record. Sometimes the decision is easy:
    download when no local record exists; upload when no database one exists.
    Other times, a combination of upload, download, remove is called for in
    an order dictated by which version of a record is the latest or is
    regarded as the most reliable. A "details" display can help in making
    that determination.</p>

    <h3> Context menu processes:</h3>

    <ul>
        <li>
            <b>upload **** to DB</b> Create or replace database copies
            of existing local records.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>download **** to local</b> Create or replace local copies
            of existing database records.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>remove **** from DB</b> Remove data records from the
            database.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>remove **** from local</b> Remove data records from
            local disk.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>remove **** from both</b> Remove data records from both
            the database and local disk.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>show record details</b> Pop up a text window that gives details
            about a data record. This may help in deciding how best to bring
            database and local copies in sync. More on the detail window is
            given below.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <p> Note that not all process options are available at every row. Some
    options are not possible for a particular data record. For example, in
    the context menu for a local-only record, only "upload to DB",
    "remove from local", and "show details" are enabled.</p>

    <p> The details window for a data record that is already in sync will show
    that the DB and local copies have the same "Content Checks" (MD5 hash
    and record size values).</p>

    <p> By contrast, the details window for a data record that exists on both
    media but is marked "Conflict" shows non-matching Content Checks.</p>
