    <h2> Manage Data Tree Help Text Window:</h2>

    <p> Manage Data provides a way with the <b>Tree Help</b> button to
    pop up a text window that explains about the tree view of your data.
    This window can be moved off to the side and provide guidance on
    the data tree until you become familiar with it. The text begins
    with an explanation of column headers, followed by a color legend
    for the row colors.</p>

    <p> As you scroll down in the window, the text explains the use of
    context menus that may be invoked on any row.</p>
