    <h2> <i>UltraScan</i> Color Gradient Generator: </h2>

    <p> Color gradients can be generated for the purpose of providing
    a third dimension to selected <b><i>UltraScan III</i></b> program graphs.</p>

    <p> Color gradients are specified with a start color and a number of
    color steps, each one having an end color and a number of points.
    The total number of colors in the gradient is the sum of step points
    plus one for the start color. The steps are saved in an XML file, with
    an option to save a PNG file with the color legend.</p>

              <b>Show Gradient</b> Draw a representation of the currently
              specified color gradient in the bottommost panel. The panel
              will adjust its size so the concentric circles portion is square
              and there is room to the right for a vertical color legend,
              with start color at the bottom.

            <li>
              <b>Save Gradient</b> Save the current color gradient to an XML
              file. A standard file dialog is used. After giving the name of
              the XML file, you will be given the option of also saving a PNG
              file that contains the color legend at the displayed size and
              with the same base name as the XML file.

              <b>Close</b> Close the color gradient generator session. If you
              have not saved the gradient to a file, you will be given a final
              opportunity to do so.
