<H2 align=left>Finite Element Analysis - Model Control Window:
</H2>
<p>
The <a href=finite_model_ctrl1.png>model control window</a> allows you to
enter initial guesses for the fitting process, control linear constraints
and determine which parameters should be floated during the fitting
process and which should stay fixed. In this window you can also control
the simulation accuracy by changing the discretization stepsize. During
the fitting process the guesses will be updated by the nonlinear least
squares fitting routine.
<p>
<b>Entering Initial Guesses:</b>
<p>
First, you need to enter initial guesses for the various parameters. Some
parameters will already have an approximated value listed, which may
or may not suffice for fitting. Generally, the closer the value of the
initial guess is to the true value, the faster the fitting process
will converge. Estimates such as the meniscus position, the total
concentration and baseline absorbance will be taken from the editing
routine. For non-interacting multi-component systems, it is assumed that
the total absorbance is equally distributed over each component. Modify
the partial concentration for each component according the integral
distribution of the van Holde - Weischet method, where you can define
groups to obtain initial guesses for the sedimentation coefficient and
the partial concentration. By clicking on the <i>Parameters for Component:</i>
counter, you can navigate between the parameter settings of all components 
defined in the model. If you selected the "Fixed Molecular Weight Distribution"
model, you can directly import the saved van Holde - Weischet model into the
model control window by clicking on <b>"Load Model"</b>. For more information
on this option, please check the information on the<a href=finite_model.html#fixed>
fixed molecular weight distribution model</a> and refer to the 
<a href=vhw.html#groups>Group Definition</a> function in the van Holde - Weischet 
analysis.
<p>
Parameters such as Slope Correction of "r" and "C,r", Sigma and Delta
(concentration dependency parameters) are initialized to zero. When
set to zero, these parameter will not have any effect on the fit. These
four parameters are the only parameters that can be excluded from the
fitting model by being set to zero, all other parameters need to have
a finite value. Of course, the baseline absorbance value can be zero,
but that does not exclude it from the model.
<p>
Enter the parameters for <i>s</i> and <i>D</i> and adjust the partial
concentration, if necessary. You can use the <a href=vbar.html>
"Calculate Protein MW and vbar" utility</a> by clicking on the
<b>"Vbar(20<sup>o</sup>C)"</b> button to set a partial specific volume,
or alternatively type the value in by hand. Be sure to enter the value
corrected for 20<sup>o</sup>C, the program will automatically correct
for temperature as described in Cohn & Edsall (<I>Proteins, Amino
Acids and Peptides as Ions and Dipolar Ions. </I>New York. Reinhold,
1943.). If you have set the buffer conditions in the finite element panel,
hydrodynamic corrections based on buffer conditions will automatically
be applied when you click on the <b>"Update for 20<sup>o</sup>C,W"</b>
button and a molecular weight will be calculated from the corrected S-
and D-values. Also, a temperature and buffer corrected S- and D-value
will be displayed in the s20,W and D20,W field. Each time you change
either the buffer values or the partial specific volume, you have to
click on the  <b>"Update for 20<sup>o</sup>C,W"</b> button to make sure
the values are properly updated.
<p>
If your model
contains more than one component, select each component by clicking on the
counter <i>Parameters for Component:</i>. Please make sure to enter the 
<i>uncorrected</i> values for <i>s</i> and <i>D</i>. If you only have
the corrected values available, adjust the value for <i>s</i> and <i>D</i>
until the corrected value matches the value shown in the <i>S 20,W</i>
and <i>D 20,W</i> field. A small inaccuracy is quite tolerable here and
can be compensated for by the finite element fitting process, however, 
the closer the value to the true value, the faster the solution will 
converge.
<p>
For the <a href=finite_model_ctrl2.png>Monomer-Dimer</a> model, the molecular
weight of the dimer is constrained by the molecular weight of
the first component (by mass action and the Svedberg relationship). This means
that the second component's molecular weight and diffusion coefficient 
cannot be changed manually. Also, the concentration dependency parameters
are greyed out, since fitting these parameters in multicomponent systems
is not justified, unless multiple experiments can be fitted simultaneously.
This functionality will be added at a later point in the Beowulf version of
<i><b>UltraScan</i></b>. The association constant for this model is fitted in
OD concentration units, if you prefer molar<sup>-1</sup> units, you will
need to convert the result, which requires knowledge of the molar extinction
coefficient.
<p>
<b>Setting Bounds:</b>
<p>
The program employs the DuD (Doesn't use Derivatives) non-linear least
squares fitting algorithm to minimize the square of the residuals. This 
algorithm requires a matrix of initial guesses which is orthogonalized 
by offsetting the diagonal element by the range of possible values.
To assure that this matrix is non-singular, the value of the range needs
to span the solution space. You have control over this process by
entering bounds that are added and subtracted from the initial guess
to form the initial guess matrix. In practice, it is recommended to 
let each parameter vary 10% - 20% of the total amount of the parameter.
The value of the bounds should also be determined by the confidence you have 
in each initial guess. For example, if you fit for the meniscus position,
you will probably not need to let the meniscus position vary by more than
2% - 3%, since this value can be determined with great confidence from the
edited data. However, diffusion coefficient estimates are much less precise,
and require a larger range for the bounds. Of course, you only need to 
enter bounds for parameters that are set to float. Fixed parameters
do not require a range setting and range settings for fixed parameters 
will have no effect. Make sure to enter <i>reasonable</i> bounds (i.e., 
no negative diffusion coefficients, or negative concentrations, etc) and make
sure not to forget to enter the bounds for each component of your model. 
<p>
<b>Constrained and unconstrained fits:</b>
<p>
In the <a href=finite_fit_ctrl1.png>fitting control</a> dialog you can
select to use linear constraints for your fit. If the fit is constrained,
the <a href=finite_model_ctrl4.png> control window</a> will indicate by
using red labels if a parameter is attempting to go outside of bounds. If
parameters are adjusted within the linear bounds by the fitting routine,
the label will switch to green. If a parameter consistently is marked
with a red label, you should examine the bounds set before fitting. Linear
constraints can help you fit a dataset by preventing nonsensical parameter
values occuring during a fit.
<p>
<b>Floating or Fixing?</b>
<p>
The general rule is to fix as many parameters as possible and to constrain
the fit as much as possible. Oftentimes, you already know the molecular
weight of the component. If you enter and fix the molecular weight, the
<i>s/D</i> ratio will be calculated according to the Svedberg relationship.
When fixing the molecular weight, you have two options: you can let the
partial specific volume float, or the diffusion coefficient. If you are not
sure of the molecular weight but have a good idea about the partial specific
volume of a sample, it is often sufficient to float the baseline, the partial
concentration as well as <i>s</i> and <i>D</i>. Don't forget to enter the
proper floating/fixing setting for all components in your model.
<p>
<b>Sloping Baselines:</b>
<p>
If your data has optical flaws, such as a sloping baseline, you can 
compensate for this error by setting the slope correction to a small,
nonzero value (on the order of 1x10<sup>-2</sup>) and floating it.
Use positive values for increasing plateaus, and negative values for 
decreasing plateaus. A second order slope correction approximation
can be achieved with "Slope Correction (C,r)", which is proportional
to <i>C</i> and linear with <i>r</i>.
<p>
<b>Discretization Intervals:</b>
<p>
Using the <i>Delta-t</i> and <i>Delta-r</i> discretization counters, 
you can adjust the stepsize for the time and radius discretization
used in the finite element solution. The smaller the step size, the more
accurate the solution, but the more time or memory it will take to 
complete the calculation. For the radius, a 1x10<sup>-3</sup> cm setting
is usually sufficient. For very small diffusion coefficients or fast run
speeds, a smaller setting may be more appropriate. If you get errors at
the bottom of the cell (oscillations of the absorbance), decrease the 
radial discretization to about 5x10<sup>-4</sup> cm. The time discretization
doesn't appear to have a lot of influence on the accuracy of the 
solution, as long as the change of the concentration gradient isn't too rapid.
For initial fits, a 10-20 sec setting is generally quite appropriate, 
for slow sedimenting material or approach-to-equilibrium experiments even
a larger setting is appropriate. Once the fit has converged, the final 
solution can still be refined with a smaller discretization stepsize.
All parameters, with the exception of the fixed/floating setting, and
the discretization settings, may be changed and adjusted manually during
the fit. For more information, see the <a href=finite_fit_ctrl.html>Fitting 
Control</a> help file.
