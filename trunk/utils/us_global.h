    /*! \brief Create or attach to shared memory

       The constructor will attach to an existing shared memory area.  If
       the area does not exist, it create it and then attach to it. 

       A shared memory area is identified by a unique key.  In this case it
       is defined as:
       
         "UltraScan" + QString( getuid() )

       In this way, each user on a multi-user system will get a uniqe key.

       Note that this has not been tested yet in Windows as Windows doesn't have 
       getuid() equivalent.  On th eother hand, it probably isn't necessary 
       because Windows generally only has one person running on a client system
       at a time.

       Right now there is only one value stored in shared memory: the location of the
       upper left corner of the last program that started.  It is initialized
       to QPoint( 50, 50 ).
