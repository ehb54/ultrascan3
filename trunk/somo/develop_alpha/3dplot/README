mesh2e

activating 'Solutes' off the pulldown
reads in 'mesh2e.mod' from the current directory, this is a .mod file 
in the standard format.  The first line in the .mod will be the title.
Additionally there is a control file. 'mesh2e.ctl' 
This controls how the graph looks.  

These are the fields, they must be single space separated if there
are multiple values in a row.

Here is an example file 
______cut_here________
.55
80 80
0 20 0 6
10 1
2 .5
______end_here________

These are the meanings
use_vbar		// the vbar for converting the D values to frictional ratios (k)
meshx meshy      	// the number of grid points in the x & y directions (s & k)
minx maxx miny maxy  	// min & max s*1e13 & k values 
maxz zscaling		//
alpha beta		// the sharpness of peaks is determined by these values
			// i'm using a cosine function of the distance within M_PI/2
			// the beta is this distance (note the distance is in scaled s values
			// (i.e. *1e13) and k values between the requested plot point and each solute vector
			// and alpha exponentiates the cos() function (i.e pow(cos(dist * M_PI/ (beta * 2)), alpha)
			// see the operator() stub of class C_s_k in functions.h for more detail

issues ...
The title gets overwritten with the default if you rotate, but pulling down 'Solute' resets it.
