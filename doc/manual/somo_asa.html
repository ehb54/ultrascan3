SOMO - Accessible Surface Area (ASA) Options Module:</h2>

<p>
In this module, you can set the parameters and options for calculating the
Accessible Surface Area (ASA) of your structure. This information is then
used by the model builder to discriminate exposed from buried beads, allowing
the exclusion of the latter from the hydrodynamic computations. In addition, it
offers the possibility of re-checking the ASA of the beads in the final bead model,
to better discriminate buried from exposed beads. The ASA module offers two alternative
methods, a Voronoi tessellation approach which is an implementation of SurfRace,
kindly provided by O.V. Tsodikov (Tsodikov OV, Record MT Jr, Sergeev YV.  Novel
computer program for fast exact calculation of accessible and molecular surface areas
and average surface curvature. J. Comput. Chem. 23:600-609, 2002), and a rolling sphere
algorithm (ASAB1, see Spotorno et al., Eur. J. Biophys. 25:373-384, 26:417, 1997; Rai et al., 
Structure 13:723-734, 2005) based on Lee and Richards' method (Lee B, Richards FM.
The interpretation of protein structures: estimation of static accessibility. J. Mol. Biol. 55:379-400, 1971).
During our testing, we found that the Voronoi method performs well for relatively small,
compact structures, but was a bit hectic when examining large structures, while ASAB1 was
more reliable and is thus presented as the default option. As for the bead re-check,
only the rolling sphere method is available.
<p>
The first two checkboxes, <i><b>Perform ASA Calculation</b></i> and <i><b>Re-check bead ASA</b></i>,
enable or disable these operations. Both are recommended (<b>default</b>).
<br>Next is the choice of the ASA method for operating on the atomic structure (PDB file),
<i><b>Voronoi Tessellation</b></i> or <i><b>Rolling Sphere</b></i>. <i><b>Rolling Sphere</b></i>
is the <b>default</b>.
<br>In the <i><b>ASA Probe Radius (A)</b></i> field, you set the radius of the
hypothetical (water) molecule used to probe the surface of the molecule for 
accessibility. The <b>default</b> value is <b>1.4 Angstroms</b>.
<br>Likewise, in the <i><b>ASA Probe Recheck Radius (A)</b></i> field, you set the
radius of the probe used to re-check the beads in the final bead model for
accessibility. The <b>default</b> value is <b>1.4 Angstroms</b>.
<br>In the <i><b>SOMO ASA Threshold (A^2)</b></i> field, you set the accessible surface
area threshold above which a main- or side-chain will be considered 
exposed to the solvent in the SoMo method. The <b>default</b> value is <b>20 A<sup>2</sup></b>.
<br>The <i><b>SOMO Bead ASA Threshold %</b></i> field lets you set the % of the surface
of a bead that must be at least accessible to re-classify as exposed a bead
previously considered to be buried in the SoMo method. Beads are initially assigned as being
buried or exposed based on the status of the main- or side-chain they represent.
However, during overlap removal some beads initially classified as buried may
become exposed, hence the need to re-check their status. This operation is 
performed if the <i><b>Re-check bead ASA</b></i> checkbox is selected (recommended).
The <b>default</b> value is <b>50%</b> for SOMO-type beads.
<br>Likewise, in the <i><b>Grid ASA Threshold (A^2)</b></i> field, you set the accessible surface
area threshold above which primary beads will be considered to be exposed to the solvent
in the AtoB (Grid) method. This will allow a better treatment of the beads during the overlap
removal phase.
<br>Finally, the <i><b>Grid Bead ASA Threshold %</b></i> field lets you set the % of the surface
of a bead that must be at least accessible to re-classify as exposed a bead
previously considered to be buried in the Grid (AtoB) method. If the <i>Enable ASA screening</i>
function in the <a href=somo_grid.html>SOMO Grid Function Options (AtoB)</a> module is <b>not</b>
selected, beads are <b>all</b> assigned as being buried, and their final status <b>must</b> be checked by
the <b>Re-check bead ASA</b> routine. The <b>default</b> value is <b>30%</b>. 
<br>The <i><b>ASAB1 Step Size (A)</b></i> field defines the increment between the 2D slices
in which the structure (or the model) is subdivided in the rolling sphere method, which are then integrated.
The <b>default</b> value is <b>1 Angstrom</b>.
