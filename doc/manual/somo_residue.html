SOMO - Residue Definition Module:</h2>

<p>
This module is used to define all residues that can be found in PDB files. 
In this module, you can also define the rules which are used to convert them
into beads. You can add new residues or modify the properties of the existing
ones. Three panels are available:
<p>
<ol>
<li> <b>Define Residue Properties</b>
<li> <b>Define Residue Atoms</b>
<li> <b>Define Residue Bead Properties</b>
</ol>

<p>In this panel, you can add or modify the general properties of a residue.
To add a new residue, you must first load the <a href="somo-2.png">atom table</a>
containing the atomic groups, as defined in the PDB file (N, CA, CB, etc.),
that make up the residue. <br>The residue name (ALA, GLY, PRO, etc.) is entered
in the <i>Residue Name</i> field, with a description entered in the <i>Description</i>
field (this will help in discriminating between entries having the same residue
name in PDB files, but differing by the presence/absence of some atoms, like
the PO<sub>2</sub> group in nucleosides/nucleotides). The <i>Number of Atoms in Residue</i>
field is then completed (note that only non-hydrogen atoms have to be counted;
for NMR-derived models, hydrogen atoms fields are discarded by the SOMO PDB
parser). <br>The next field, <i>Number of Beads for Residue</i>, defines how many
beads will be used to represent the residue. For amino acids or nucleic acid
bases, we suggest to use a bead for the main-chain and another for the side-chain
segments, plus one for the PO<sub>2</sub> group in nucleotides. For carbohydrates,
a bead per residue will usually suffice. More complicated entries, like heme or NAD,
must be assigned to a reasonable number of beads taking into account geometric and
chemical considerations. Many entries are already defined in the <i>somo.residue</i>
file distributed with the program.
<br>The <i>Residue Type</i> field is then defined from the pull-down list,
presently including:
<p>
<ul>
<li>Amino Acid
<li>Sugar Moiety
<li>Nucleotide
<li>Heme
<li>Phosphate
<li>Co-factor
<li>Ion
<li>Detergent
<li>Other
</ul>
<p>
The <i>Residue anhydrous mol. vol. (A^3)</i> field has to be filled with a 
value usually derived from crystallography (see Tsai et al., J. Mol. Biol.
290:253-266, 1999; Nadassy et al., Nucl. Acid Res. 29:3362-3376, 2001; Voss
and Gerstein, J. Mol. Biol. 346:477-492, 2005; Perkins, Eur. J. Biochem. 
157:169-180, 1986). This is the volume that defines the total anhydrous volume
of the bead(s) that will be used to model the residue, and for non tabulated
entries it can be computed using on-line programs such as the <sup>3</sup>V Contact Volume Calculator (<a href="http://www.molmovdb.org/cgi-bin/3v.cgi">http://www.molmovdb.org/cgi-bin/3v.cgi</a>; a 0
Angstrom probe radius should be used). For ions, we used the values in Table I of
Kiriukhin and Collins (Biophys. Chem. 99:155-168, 2002).
<br>In contrast, the <i>Residue partial spec. vol. (cm^3/g)</i> field pertains to
the solution partial specific volume (<i>vbar</i>) of the residue (in water @ 20°C),
and is used to compute the global <i>vbar</i> of the model, necessary to determine
the sedimentation coefficient from the translational frictional coefficient. 
Tabulated values are available for amino acids and some carbohydrates (see Perkins,
Eur. J. Biochem. 157:169-180, 1986), or can be computed using the Cohn and Edsall method
(Cohn and Edsall, Proteins, amino acids and peptides as ions and dipolar ions, Reinhold
Publ. Comp., 1965, pp. 370-381; see also Durchschlag and Zipper, Biophys. Chem. 93:
141-157, 2001; Durchschlag and Zipper, J. Appl. Cryst. 30:803-807, 1997; Durchschlag
and Zipper, Prog. Colloid Polym. Sci. 94:20-39, 1994). For ions,
it was computed directly from the anhydrous mol. vol. (cm<sup>3</sup>)
multiplied by Avogadro's number and divided by the molecular weight.
<br>Finally, the <i>Max. Accessible Surface Area (A^2)</i> field is entered. It is
used for control purposes only, to calculate the percentage accessible surface
area (ASA) of each residue with respect to this theoretical maximum value. For
amino acids, it was taken from the tabulated values of Gly-XXX-Gly tripeptides
(Miller et al., J. Mol. Biol. 196:641-656, 1987). For ions, it was computed
from the radius (Table I of Kiriukhin and Collins, Biophys. Chem. 99:155-168, 2002).
For the other entries currently present in the <i>somo.residue</i> file, it was computed
on isolated moieties using the <sup>3</sup>V Contact Volume Calculator (see above) with
a 1.4 A probe radius. 

<p>When all fields have been filled, the residue is accepted by pressing the
<b>Accept Residue and Continue</b> button, and the <i>Number of Residues in File
</i> field is consequently updated.

<p>In this panel, the atoms making up the residue are chosen, using the
<a href="somo-2.png">atom table</a> previously selected. The atoms are numbered
sequentially up to the value entered in the <i>Number of Atoms in Residue</i>
field in the previous panel, and can be chosen from the <i>Select Residue Atom
 to be defined</i> pull-down menu.
<br>An atom type is then selected from the pull-down menu in the
<i>Select Atom from Lookup Table</i> menu, and an available hybridization
is then chosen from the <i>Select Hybridization for Atom</i> pull-down menu 
below it. <br>If the current atom will contribute to the definition of the
position of the bead to which it will be assigned (next panel), the
<i>Atom determines Position</i> checkbox must be selected.
<br>The <b>Assign Current Atom</b> button is then clicked, and the <i>Select 
Residue Atom to be defined</i> field is then updated.
<br>This operation is repeated until all atoms in the residue have been assigned,
and the <b>Continue</b> button can then be pressed.

<b>Panel 3: Define Residue Bead Properties:</b>

<p>In the last panel of this module, the atoms in each residue are assigned
to bead(s), and each bead's properties are then defined.
<br>According to the value entered in the <i>Number of Beads for Residue</i>
field in Panel 1, the <i>Select Residue Bead to be defined</i> pull-down menu
will allow to select a bead from the list. All subsequent operations will affect
the selected bead only.
<br>First a color is assigned to the bead using the <i>Select Bead Color</i>
pull-down menu. Be aware that two colors are presently reserved to "label"
the beads so that they can be automatically excluded from the hydrodynamic
computations, colors "0" (black) and "6" (brown), so they should NOT be used.
To avoid they inadvertent selection, a Warning pop-up will appear if color "0" or
"6" are chosen, with this message: "Black and brown are reserved colors, please
chose a different color". In addition, we color-code "7" (white) exposed beads
that are fused together, and "8" (grey) beads that were originally labeled as
buried ("6") but are found to be above the exposure threshold upon re-check.
In the <a href="somo-residue-3.png">residue table</a> (an excerpt of the current 
<i>somo.residue</i> is shown) provided with the UltraScan distribution, the colors
are assigned so to label the beads as:
<p>
<ol>
0. - Black: RESERVED, automatically assigned to very small beads (always excluded from computations)
<li>- Blue: protein main-chain
<li>- Green: protein acidic side-chain (D,E)
<li>- Cyan: protein hydrophobic side-chain (A,V,L,I,F,W)
<li>- Red: protein polar side-chain (H,Y,S,T,N,Q)
<li>- Magenta: protein non-polar side-chain (C,M,P)
<li>- Brown: RESERVED for buried beads (automatically assigned during model generation)
<li>- White: USED for fused beads
<li>- Grey: USED for previously buried beads found to be exposed on re-check
<li>- Light Blue: carbon monoxide
<li>- Light Green: USED by the Automatic Bead Builder for non-coded residues (see <a
href=somo_pdb_parsing.html>here</a>)
<li>- Light Cyan: bases in DNA/RNA, oxygen, 13P
<li>- Light Red: heme, NAD, other co-factors, some prosthetic groups and ions, PO<sub>2</sub>
<li>- Light Magenta: carbohydrates (including sugar rings in nucleotides), some ions
<li>- Yellow: protein basic side-chain (K,R)
<li>- Bright White: unassigned
</ol>
<p> 
The next field, <i>Hydration Number for Bead</i>, assigns a
theoretical number of water of hydration molecules to the bead. For amino acids,
this number is defined for each residue side- and main-chain based on the values 
reported by Kuntz and Kauzmann (Adv. Protein Chem. 28:239-345, 1974). For carbohydrates,
we used the values of  Shiio (J. Am. Chem. Soc. 80:70-73, 1958). For ions, we used the
values in Table I of Kiriukhin and Collins (Biophys. Chem. 99:155-168, 2002).
For the other residues, and for further information, see Brookes et al., Eur. Biophys. J.
in press, 2009, and Rai et al., Structure 13:723-734, 2005. The volume of 
these water molecule(s) (defined under the <b>Miscellaneous Options</b>;
see <a href=somo_misc.html>here</a>) will be later automatically added to the
anhydrous volume of the bead to define its hydrated volume and radius.
<p>
<br>Next comes the <i>Select Positioning Method</i> field, offering three
options:
<p><i>Center of gravity</i>: between the atoms assigned to the bead and marked
"yes" in the <i>Atom determines Position</i> checkbox in Panel 2;
<br><i>Farthest atom</i>: from the center of gravity of the molecule, again
between the atoms assigned to the bead and marked "yes" in the
<i>Atom determines Position</i> checkbox in Panel 2;
<br><i>No positioning</i>: to exclude the bead from the model.
<p>Currently, only the "Center of gravity" option is being used.
<p>Each bead needs then to be defined as belonging to the <i>backbone</i>
or to the <i>sidechain</i> of the molecule by clicking the appropriate box
in the <i>This Bead is part of the:</i> field. This determines at which sequential stage the bead
will be processed during overlap removal.
<br>The <i>Bead Volume</i> field defines the anhydrous volume (in A<sup>3</sup>) assigned
to the bead. IMPORTANT: the sum of the volumes of the bead(s) defining a residue
MUST match the <i>Residue anhydrous mol. vol.</i> entered in Panel 1. The
program will NOT let you save the residue/bead definition if there is a
discrepancy between these two values. The values present in the current
definitions of the amino acid residues were derived from the crystallographic
analysis (see above for references). When a molecule needs to be subdived in more
than one bead, the volumes of the various parts can be determined using the
<sup>3</sup>V Contact Volume Calculator (see above). However, the parts' volumes
will NOT add up to the entire molecule volume, and MUST be then proportionally
rescaled. The volume of all other entries in the current <i>somo.residue</i> table
were determined in this way.
<br>The next two fields, <i>Bead Mol. Weight</i> and <i> Bead hydrated Volume,
Radius</i> are for visualization only, and will display respectively the
bead molecular weight, calculated from the values (taken from the <a href=
"somo-2.png">atom table</a>) of the atoms assigned to the bead, and its hydrated
molecular volume and hydrated radius (derived by summing to the anhydrous 
<i>Bead Volume</i> the volume of the water of hydration molecules). These two
fields will display the values when the <b>Accept Bead Definition</b> button is
pressed (see below).
<br>The last step is the assignment of atoms to the bead. In the <i>Select Atom
for Bead (multi-selection OK)</i> window, you can see the list of all the atoms
that belong to the residue, as defined previously in Panel 2. By clicking on
an atom, it will be also displayed in the <i>Currently defined Atoms for Bead</i>
window to the left. Once all atoms belonging to a bead have been selected, the
bead is accepted by clicking on the <b>Accept Bead Definition</b> button.
<br>If the residue is represented by more than one bead, the process is repeated
until all beads have been processed. The residue can then be added to the file
by clicking on the <b>Add Residue to File</b> button. The process can be
interrupted at any stage by pressing the <b>Reset</b> button.

<p>To Edit an already defined residue, double-click on its name on the list
(that can be scrolled) present in the window next to the <i>Number of residues in
File</i> field in Panel 1. All the stored properties will then appear
first in the Panel 1 fields, which can then be updated. By clicking on the
<b>Accept Residue and Continue</b> button, the properties listed in Panel 2
become then accessible, and can be likewise edited. Finally, the Panel 3
options will become again available for editing by clicking on the
<b>Assign Current Atom</b> button in Panel 2. <b>Accept Bead Definition</b>
and <b>Add Residue to File</b> buttoms will then allow to update the
<a href="somo-residue-3.png">residue table</a> (<i>somo.residue</i>).
<br>A selected residue/bead definition can be also removed from the file by
clicking on the <b>Delete Residue</b> button.
<br>Pressing <b>Close</b> will then exit from the <b>Modify Residue Lookup 
Tables</b> menu and return the operator to the <b>Main menu</b>.
