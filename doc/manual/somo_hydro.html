SOMO - Hydrodynamic Calculations  Options Module:</h2>

In this module, various options controlling the computations of the hydrodynamic
parameters for the bead model can be set.
<br>The <i>Structure units (-10 = Angstrom, -9 = nanometer)</i> field sets the
scale units of the bead model being examined. Models derived from PDB structures
are in Angstrom units, but the user might wish to compute the hydrodynamic
parameters for bead models coming from different sources, for instance from
small angle solution scattering data, which might be in other units like
nanometers. The field sets the exponential relating the units to meters (default:
<b>-10</b>).
<br>The <b>Computations Relative to</b> box presents two alternative options,
<b>Diffusion Center</b> and <b>Cartesian Origin</b>. The differences between the
two are subtle, and are fully described in Garcia de la Torre and Bloomfield,
Q. Rev. Biophys. 14:81-139, 1981 (default: <b>Diffusion Center</b>).
<br>The <b>Boundary Conditions</b> box also has two alternative options,
<b>Stick</b> (6&pi&eta<sub>0</sub>) or <b>Slip</b> (4&pi&eta<sub>0</sub>). For 
beads whose size is greater than the hypothetical solvent molecules, like those
generated by the default SOMO settings, the <b>stick boundary conditions</b>
apply. The <b>slip boundary conditions</b> should be used only when each atom
is represented with a bead (see Venable and Pastor, Biopolymers 27:1001-1014,
1988; Garcia de la Torre and Bloomfield, Q. Rev. Biophys. 14:81-139, 1981) 
(default: <b>Stick</b>).
<br>The <b>Bead Mass Correction</b> box has two checkboxes allowing the user
to select or override the <b>Automatic</b> computation of the mass of the model
obtained by summing over the mass assigned to each bead. This can be done by
selecting the <b>Manual</b> checkbox and entering a value in the <i>Enter mass
</i> field. For normal operations on models generated by SOMO from PDB files,
the <b>Automatic</b> option will do fine. The <b>Manual</b> option is mainly
for analyzing models generated from external sources, for which the beads might
not carry the mass information, and only the total mass is known. The total mass
is necessary for the computation of the <i>Sedimentation Coefficient</i> and
of the <i>Intrinsic Viscosity</i> (default: <b>Automatic</b>).
<br>Similarly, the <b>Bead Volume Correction</b> box has two options,
<b>Automatic</b> and <b>Manual</b>. In the <b>Automatic</b> mode, the value is
obtained by computing the volume of each bead included in the hydrodynamic
computations (see the <b>Buried Beads Inclusion</b> box below) and summing up
their values. The <b>Volume Correction</b> is important for the proper
computation of the <i>Rotational Diffusion Coefficient</i> and of the
<i>Intrinsic Viscosity</i> (Garcia de la Torre and Rodes, J. Chem. Phys.
79:2454-2460, 1983; Garcia de la Torre and Carrasco, Eur. Biophys. J. 27:549-557,
1998). It should be left in <b>Automatic</b> mode unless there are serious
reasons for entering a different value in the <i>Enter Volume</i> field after
selecting the <b>Manual</b> checkbox. Entering a <b>Manual</b> value will also
render ineffective any choice made in the <b>Include Buried Beads in volume
correction for calculation of</b> box below (default: <b>Automatic</b>).
<br>The <b>Buried Bead Inclusion</b> box allows to either <b>Exclude</b> or
<b>Include</b> the beads labeled as buried in the hydrodynamic computations.
We have demonstrated (Rai et al., Structure 13:723-734, 2005) that excluding
the buried beads has no effect on the translational diffusion properties, and
could even improve the computation of the <i>rotational diffusion</i> and
<i>intrinsic viscosity</i>. Moreover, as the memory required by the full
supermatrix inversion procedure implemented in the hydrodynamics computations
module grows exponentially with the number of beads employed, excluding the
buried beads from the computations allows both a faster processing and the
capability of processing bigger structures (default: <b>Exclude</b>).
<br>The <b>Include Buried Beads in volume correction for calculation of</b> box
gives the possibility, when the buried beads are <b>Excluded</b> from the
hydrodynamic computations, of nevertheless summing their volume to that of the
exposed beads for the computation of the <i>volume correction</i> for either,
both or neither the <b>Rotational Diffusion</b> and the <b>Intrinsic Viscosity</b>
(see above for explanations on the <i>volume correction</i>). However, if a
<b>Manual</b> value is entered in the <b>Bead Volume Correction</b> above, these
choices have no effect. In any case, our testing (Rai et al., Structure 13:723-
734, 2005) has suggested that if the buried beads are excluded from the
hydrodynamic computations, their volume should <b>not</b> be included in the
<i>volume correction</i> niether for the <b>Rotational Diffusion</b> nor for
the <b>Intrinsic Viscosity</b> (default: <b>both deselected</b>).
<br>Finally, the <b>Overlap cut-off</b> box allows the user to select a different
cut-off when checking the model before the hydrodynamic computations (it should
be recalled that the <i>hydrodynamic interaction tensor</i> used is valid only
for non-overlapping beads). If an overlap exceeding the threshold is found
between any couple of beads, the computations are halted. An overlap cut-off is
already present in the <b>Bead Overlap Reduction</b> set-up options, and if the
bead model has been internally generated, then the <b>From Bead Model</b>
checkbox should be selected. For models generated in other ways, the tolerance
can be increased (at your own risk!) by selecting the <b>Manual</b> checkbox
and entering a value in the <i>Enter cut-off</i> field (default: <b>From Bead
Model</b>).
