way SOMO reads and loads the various fields present in PDB files.

In the <b>Miscellaneous parsing options</b> subpanel, the four options listed are
<b>not</b> presently selectable. The first three are currently hard-coded in the 
program, while the fourth is in the planning stage.
<p>
<ul>
<li>
<b><i>Skip hydrogen atoms</i></b>. Explicit hydrogen atoms are found in NMR- or neutron crystallography-derived structures, and are <b>not</b> coded for in the distributed <i>somo.residue</i> file. Therefore, the parser automatically skips any line containing
them. In the current SOMO implementation, the hydrogen atoms are "included" in the heavy
 atoms to which they are bound, but we do not exclude to make the skipping as an option
to allow users to explicitly treat hydrogens; obviously, this will call for a re-definition
of all atoms and residues in the <i>somo.hybrid</i>, <i>somo.atom</i>, and <i>somo.residue</i> files.

<li>
<b><i>Skip solvent water molecules</i></b>. In the current SOMO implementation, the water
of hydration is treated in a statistical manner. Therefore, lines in PDB files coding for
explicit crystallographic water molecules are automatically skipped. However, we plan to make 
this as an option in the future, since one might wish to investigate the effect of the
crystallographic waters on the hydrodynamics, or to use artificial hydration schemes 
employing explicit water molecules. As for the previous field, using explicit waters will
also call for a re-definition of the hydration numbers in the <i>somo.residue</i> file.

<li>
<b><i>Skip alternate conformations</i></b>. PDB files sometimes contain alternate coordinates
for particular atoms within residues. It is presently <b>not</b> possible to explore the effect
of these alternate conformations, which should be negligible anyway. Therefore, presently
SOMO uses only the first ("A") alternate conformation by default. In the future, we might
provide the choice between the alternate conformations.

<li>
<b><i>Find free SH, change residue coding</i></b>. In the <i>somo.residue</i> file, cysteine
(CYS) is treated as if it's always engaged in a S-S bond with another cysteine (cystine). This
is because currently there's no distinction in PDB files between cysteines and cystines. Since
this involves slightly different physico-chemical parameters (e.g., two H atoms are lost when
a S-S bridge is formed), we plan to offer an automatic "free SH" finder by checking the distances
between all sulphur atoms in CYS residues. Those that won't be within bonding distance from another CYS will be considered as free SH, and their residue name changed to CYH, for which the coding is already provided within the <i>somo.residue</i> file. Users wishing to deal with this problem now
can manually edit their PDB file and change to CYH the name of the CYS residues that they know are not
S-S bonded.

The next two subpanels deal with non-coded residues and missing atoms, respectively.

<p>
In the <b>If non-coded residues are found:</b> subpanel, the user will be able to choose between three
options, but <b>only the first two</b> are presently available:

<ul>
<li>
<b><i>List them and stop operation</i></b>. This is the most rigorous option, and calls for
properly define the "new" residue in the <i>somo.residue</i> (and in the <i>somo.atom</i>, if
"new" atoms are also present) file(s). The program is therefore halted, waiting for proper action
to be taken. Presently, this is the <b>default</b> option for this subpanel.

<li>
<b><i>List them, skip residue and proceed</i></b>. This is the least rigorous option, as skipping
residues will affect the computations on two levels. First, if the skipped residues are exposed,
their contribution to the hydrodynamics will be missed. Second, their contribution to the molecular
weight and partial specific volume of the structure will be also missed, although this can be
bypassed by entering global values in the appropriate fields (respectively in the
<a href=somo_hydro.html><b><i>SOMO Hydrodynamic Calculation Options</i></b></a> and
<a href=somo_misc.html><b><i>Miscellaneous Options</i></b></a> panels). Therefore, this option should be used only if the skipped residue(s) is (are) known to <b>not</b> likely contribute to the hydrodynamics, and by entering appropriate global values for the molecular weight and partial specific volume. Be aware, however, that the <i>total volume</i> of the bead model, used in the <i>Volume Correction</i>, will likely be <b>underestimated</b> (unless the skipped residues are all buried), thus affecting the computation of the <i>Rotational Diffusion Coefficient</i> and of the <i>Intrinsic Viscosity</i> (see <a href=somo_hydro.html>here</a> for more explanations on this subject).<br>
In any case, if this option is selected, the pop-up window shown below will appear warning of the potential errors and suggesting to enter appropriate values for the global molecular weight and partial specific volume.
</ul>

<p>

<td align=justify>

<ul>
<li>
<b><i>Use automatic bead builder (approximate method)</i></b>. <i>NOT YET IMPLEMENTED</i><br>
This is a "patch" option, allowing to roughly define a <b>single</b> "side-chain" bead for each non-coded residue. This procedure is based on an "average" volume for each atom (with an "average" molecular weight and hydration number), from which a global volume (and molecular weight) is calculated. An "average" radius for each atom is
also provided for the ASA routines (see <a href=somo_asa.html>here</a>). The bead is then placed at the center of mass of <b>all</b> the atoms within the non-coded residue, and an "average" partial specific volume and color-coding ("10", light green) are also assigned to it. All these "average" values can be modified in the
<a href=somo_misc.html><b><i>Miscellaneous Options</i></b></a> panel. As with the second option, the approximations introduced in the molecular weight and partial specific volume can be bypassed by entering global values in the appropriate fields (respectively in the
<a href=somo_hydro.html><b><i>SOMO Hydrodynamic Calculation Options</i></b></a> and in the <a href=somo_misc.html><b><i>Miscellaneous Options</i></b></a> panels. In any case, a pop-up window will appear asking for entering appropriate values for the global molecular weight and partial specific volume, and prompting to check the approximate method parameters.<br>
This will be the default option for this subpanel, since it will allow users to process virtually
any PDB file without updating the definitions files.

<p>
In the <b>If missing atoms within a residue are found:</b>  subpanel, the user will be able to choose between three
options, but <b>only the first two</b> are presently available:

<ul>
<li>
<b><i>List them and stop operation (fix it with WHATIF)</i></b>. This is the most rigorous option, and calls for either manually build the missing atoms in the PDB file, or, for proteins, to use an automatic missing atom(s) builder such as WHATIF (<a href="http://swift.cmbi.ru.nl/servers/html/index.html">http://swift.cmbi.ru.nl/servers/html/index.html</a>; WARNING: WHATIF will <b>not</b> build missing <b>main chain </b> atoms, only
<b>side chain</b> atoms). The program is therefore halted, waiting for proper action to be taken. Presently, this is the <b>default</b> option for this subpanel.

<li>
<b><i>List them, skip entire residue and proceed</i></b>. This is the least rigorous option, as skipping residues will affect the computations on two levels. First, if the skipped residues are exposed, their contribution to the hydrodynamics will be missed. Second, their contribution to the molecular weight and partial specific volume of the structure will be also missed, although this can be bypassed by entering global values in the appropriate fields (respectively in the <a href=somo_hydro.html><b><i>SOMO Hydrodynamic Calculation Options</i></b></a> and
<a href=somo_misc.html><b><i>Miscellaneous Options</i></b></a> panels). Therefore, this option should be used only if the skipped residue(s) is (are) known to <b>not</b> likely contribute to the hydrodynamics, and by entering appropriate global values for the molecular weight and partial specific volume. Be aware, however, that the <i>total volume</i> of the bead model, used in the <i>Volume Correction</i>, will then likely be <b>underestimated</b> (unless the skipped residues are all buried), thus affecting the computation of the <i>Rotational Diffusion Coefficient</i> and of the <i>Intrinsic Viscosity</i> (see <a href=somo_hydro.html>here</a> for more explanations on this subject).<br>
In any case, if this option is selected, the pop-up window shown below will appear suggesting to enter appropriate values for the global molecular weight and partial specific volume. The reason why only the missing atoms <b>cannot</b> be skipped is because they might be used to define the position of the bead, so their absence <b>cannot</b> be tolerated.

<td align=justify>

<ul>

<li>
<b><i>Use approximate method to generate bead</i></b>. <i>NOT YET IMPLEMENTED</i><br>
This is a "patch" option, allowing to roughly define a <b>single</b> bead for the whole residue. See the <b><i>Use automatic bead builder (approximate method)</i></b> above for the explanation of this procedure. The only relevant difference will be that the parameters used to define the <b>single</b> bead used to represent incomplete residues will be those of the atoms present in the residue, taken from the <i>somo.residue</i> file. As for the previous option, if this option is selected a pop-up window will appear asking for entering appropriate values for the global molecular weight and partial specific volume (this request can, however, be skipped).<br>
This will be the defaut option for this subpanel, since it will allow users to process virtually any PDB file without updating the definitions files, but for more accurate results we <b>strongly</b> recommend to switch to the first option in this subpanel and take appropriate action(s).
