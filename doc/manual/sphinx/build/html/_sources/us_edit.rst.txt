All experimental data acquired with the analytical ultracentrifuge must be processed into an edit profile before analysis can be performed using UltraScanIII modules. For velocity experiment, the edit profiles define key analysis parameters, including the meniscus and data range, and scans selected. A user can choose to create multiple edit profiles for a particular data set, for example, to explore the effect of various editing steps on the analysis results. For example, a user may wish to exclude either early or late scans to track time dependent changes in the sample. Each profile will receive a unique name automatically based on the time at which the editing process was conducted or a user-defined name. For data analysis, any associated edit profile may be selected at run time to provide a custom data selection.

  * - **Specify Meniscus**
    - This button enables the edit range selection step to be set to specify the meniscus via Ctrl-Click on the meniscus position. The radius value of the selected point is displayed in the text box tothe right of the button.
  * - **Specify Data Range** 
    - This button enables the edit range selection step to be set to specify the data range via Ctrl-Click's on the start and end data positions. The radius values of the selected points are displayed in the text box to the right of the button.

    - This button analyzes all scans to determine any radial invariant noise. It brings up a window that shows polynomial coefficients for a best fit of the scan integral. Residuals to this integral represent radially invariant noise. Subtracting the residual values from each data point in a scan will correct radially invariant noise. It is important that the loss of mass in the data as a function of time is properly matched to an appropriate polynomial, so select a polynomial degree thatprovides the best overall fit to all integral values.

Editing Steps
====================

.. note:: 
    When editing, the plot may be zoomed by selecting the Zoom button on the graph and dragging the mouse over the area desired. This operation may be repeated as needed. Each right mouse click will un-zoom one level. Clicking on the Zoom button again at any zoom level will restore the un-zoomed graph.
    
    When zoomed, the graph may be panned by pressing the center mouse button (usually the scroll wheel) and dragging.

*   **Step 1:** Load data from the database or a local data directory that contains the UltraScanIII data files previously converted from the Beckman raw data. Load choices are made in a `Load Data Dialog <load_auc.html>`_.

*    **Step 2:** Select the Cell / Channel / Wavelength triple to be edited.

*    **Step 3:** Specify the meniscus of the data by holding down the Control key and using the left mouse button. The meniscus value may be manually adjusted with the keyboard.

*    **Step 4:** If the data were collected with the interference detector, specify the left and right edges of the air gap area of the data.

*     **Step 5:** Specify the left and right edges of the data to be analyzed. Please note: Do not pick the left data edge too close to the meniscus. During meniscus fitting, the evaluated meniscus positions may reach inside of the data range and violate the boundary conditions of the finite element solution. This will cause the meniscus fit to fail.

*    **Step 6:** Specify the location of the scan plateau. This is the radial position where most scans have a stable plateau, but the selected position should not reach into the back-diffusion region. The most appropriate point tends to be close to the right edge of the data range, but not so far to the right that it extends into the region where the concentration of the later scans curves upward at the bottom of the cell due to back-diffusion.

*   **Step 7:** Make any other optional adjustments to the data that are necesary and save the edit profile. When saving, a pop-up message is presented asking for an edit ID. The default for this ID is the current date and time in the form of YYMMddhhmm (Year / Month / Day / Hour / Minute), but this default can be supplemented with a suffix of your own choice.

*   **Step 8:** Repeat the above process for each triple (Cell / Channel / Wavelength combination) in the data set. 
  

.. Note:: The above process may be reset to any point by pressing the appropriate button at the associated specification entry.

Edit Multi-Wavelength (MWL) Data 
========================================

.. image:: USstatic/images/us_edit_mwl.png

Where the data loaded in an editing session is comprised of multiple wavelengths (more than two), the main editor window is changed to the above form. Instead of selecting triples to edit, this MWL edit procedure consists of selecting Cell / Channel pairs and the wavelengths within those doubles. Once editing in the normal way has been completed, the user may save the edit for either the specific triple ("Save Current Edit Profile") or for all of the wavelengths of the current double ("Save to all Wavelengths").

Most of the edit controls for MWL are the same as for the standard :ref:`Data Editor Window <US-edit-Functions>`; and are not repeated here. The steps and control objects described herein are those specific to MWL processing.

Editing steps specific to MWL
-------------------------------

*   **Step 2:** Select the Cell / Channel to be edited; specify the Lambda (wavelength) range to be edited; and select a single wavelength for display and edit.
*   **Step 3:** Specify editing parameters - such as Meniscus, Data Range, and Plateau - in the normal Control-Click way. 
*   **Step 4:** Save editing for either the specific triple selected or to be applied to all wavelengths of a cell / channel double.
