SOMO - Solution Modeler (Bead and SAXS/SANS Modeler for NMR and X-ray structures):</h2>
</center>
<p>
<h3><center>Last updated: March 2012 </center></h3><p>
The SOMO (SOlution MOdeller) module of UltraScan initially contained only
a bead modelling utility that was originally developed by the Rocco and
Byron labs, respectively at the Istituto Nazionale per la Ricerca sul Cancro (IST,
Genova, Italy) and at the University of Glasgow (Glasgow, Scotland,
UK). The original code was mainly written by B. Spotorno, G. Tassara,
N. Rai and M. Nollmann. The bead modeling utility in SOMO is based on
a reduced representation of a biomacromolecule, starting from its atomic
coordinates (PDB format), as a set of non-overlapping beads of different radii,
from which the hydrodynamic properties can be calculated using the Garcia
de la Torre-Bloomfield rigid-body approach (García de la Torre and Bloomfield,
Q. Rev. Biophys. 14:81-139, 1981). The reduced representation is afforded by
grouping together atoms and substituting them with a bead of the same volume,
appropriately positioned. Importantly, the volume of the water of hydration
theoretically bound to each group of atoms can be then added to each
bead. The overlaps between the beads are then removed in sequential
steps, but preserving as much as possible the original surface envelope
of the bead model. The method has been fully validated and reported in the
literature (Rai et al., Structure 13:723-734, 2005; Brookes et al., Eur. Biophys. J., 39:423-435, 2010;
Brookes et al., Macromol. Biosci. 10:746-753, 2010). Among the main advantages of this method over shell-modelling
and grid-based procedures are a better treatment of the hydration water and the preservation of a
direct correspondence between beads and original residues. For instance,
the latter feature could be used to include flexibility effects into
the computations. Furthermore, by identifying and excluding from the
hydrodynamic computations beads that are buried and thus not in contact
with the solvent, a large span in the size of the structures that can
be analysed with this method without loss of precision is obtained:
currently, structures from 5K to 250K have been successfully studied. Recently,
we have also improved the original AtoB grid method (Byron, Biophys. J. 72:408-415, 1997),
which was already included within US-SOMO, by adding the theoretical hydration,
accessible surface area screening, and a better preservation of the original surface.
The improved AtoB could be very useful to study large structures and complexes.<br>
Within this new US-SOMO release you will find several additions to what wll be a fully functional
Small-Angle X-ray or Neutron Scattering (SAXS/SANS) simulator, which will work on either the original atomic
structure, or on a bead model, and will also process experimental data. Presently, the pairwise-distance
distribution function <i>P(r)</i> vs. <i>r</i> computation is fully operational, and several methods are offered for the computation of SAXS <i>I(q)</i> vs. <i>q</i> curves. Some of these methods require explicit hydration of the PDB structures. We are currently (March 2012) refining our own hydration method, which is, however, not yet ready for full release. In other areas, the batch operations
module has been expanded to include supercomputing access, with an interface to Discrete Molecular Dynamics (DMD) programs (Dokholyan, NV, Buldyrev, SV, Stanley, HE, and EI Shaknovich. Discrete molecular dynamics studies of the folding of a protein-like model. (1998) Folding & Design 3:577-587; Ding F, Dokholyan NV. Emergence of protein fold families through rational design. Public Library of Science Comput Biol. (2006) 2(7):e85). Other additions include a model classifier in which calculated parameters can be compared and ranked against experimental data, and a PDB editor.

<h3><b>General description:</b></h3>
<p>
<P>
The program main window contains an upper bar from which all the options
governing its operations can be controlled, and a main panel for program
execution. However, due to its high level of sophistication, properly setting all
the available options can be non-trivial for the general user. Therefore,
the SOMO module is distributed with pre-defined default options that should
allow the direct conversion of a PDB-formatted biomacromolecular structure
file into a bead model, and the computation of its hydrodynamic properties,
without the need of accessing the advanced options menus.
In particular, the SOMO approach is based on properly defining the atoms and
residues found in PDB files, and the rules allowing their conversion
into beads. The SOMO distribution includes the definition of all the standard
amino acids, nucleotides, carbohydrates, and common prosthetic groups and 
co-factors, but this list is by no means exhaustive, and the need to code for
"new" residues is not a remote possibility. As this operation can be demanding,
notwithstanding the user-friendly GUI governing it, the pre-defined set of options
includes approximate methods to deal with either missing atoms within coded residues,
and/or not yet coded residues. The available options are to <b>skip</b> non-coded
residues and/or coded residues with missing atoms (<b>not</b> the default option),
or to <b>generate</b> a single bead for each non-coded residue using <b>average</b>
parameters. For coded residues with missing atoms, since most often this is due to
lack of crystallographic data, there's the option of using the <b>complete residue</b>'s
bead(s), appropriately positioned. Obviously, there's <b>no cure</b> for completely
missing residues, which will have to be built in the original structure for reliable
results, since the structure should contain all residues and atoms that are present
in the "real" macromolecule studied in solution. Therefore, for best performance all
residues should be properly coded in the SOMO tables (see below).

<p><b>SOMO Program:</b>

These functions control the execution of the SOMO program, whose progress is
recorded in the right-side main window (in the picture above, a snapshot of the
messages during the model building phase of the 8RAT.pdb structure is shown). They are
divided in three subpanels controlling operations that deal with the primary PDB file
(<b>PDB Functions:</b>), operations relating the generation of bead models (<b>Bead Model
Functions:</b>), and the computation of the hydrodynamic parameters (<b>Hydrodynamic Calculations:</b>).<p>

<p>
<b>PDB Functions:</b><br>
On launching, US-SOMO will automatically load the last used lookup table (default: <i>somo.residue</i>),
where all the informations needed to convert the residues present in atomic structures into beads are stored.
To select a different lookup table, click on <i><b>Select Lookup Table</b></i>. You can create multiple
lookup tables for different conditions.
The lookup table needs to contain all atoms and residues present in the (macro)molecule
to be loaded in the next step. By default, SOMO will automatically load the last used <i>*.residue</i> table.<br>
Two alternative options are available to load an atomic structure, such as those derived from NMR or X-ray
crystallography data, the <i><b>Batch Mode Operation</b></i> (see <a href="somo_batch.html">here</a>),
or the standard <i><b>Load Single PDB File</b></i>.
Selecting a PBD file will also automatically call the molecular visualization program <i>RasMol</i>
(Sayle RA, Milner-White EJ. RasMol: biomolecular graphics for all. Trends Biochem. Sci. 20:374-376, 1995)
which will display the structure(s) in a pop-up window. For <i>Linux</i>-based systems, <i>RasMol</i> needs to be installed in
<pre><b>$ULTRASCAN/bin</b></pre> for 32 bit machines, and <pre><b>$ULTRASCAN/bin64</b></pre>
for 64 bit platforms. You can get a copy of <i>RasMol</i> from <a href="http://www.umass.edu/microbio/rasmol/">
http://www.umass.edu/microbio/rasmol/</a> or from <a href="http://openrasmol.org/#Software">
http://openrasmol.org/#Software</a>.<p> Besides visualizing the structure, the HEADER and TITLE fields of the PDB file
will be displayed in the progress window, followed by the residues list in both three- and one-letter codes, and by the 
partial specific volume (vbar), molecular weight, molecular volume computed both from vbar and from the individual atomic
volumes, and the average electron density of each chain and of the whole structure.
If problems are encountered with the selected PDB file, like the presence of non-coded residues or missing atoms within coded residues, they will be reported in the progress window either as <i>warnings</i> or <i>errors</i>. In the latter case, 
the program execution will be also halted, waiting for corrective action to be taken. The original
PDB file can be viewed and, if necessary, edited by clicking on the "<i><b>View/Edit PDB File</b></i>
button. In addition, we are currently developing an advanced <i><b>PDB editor</b></i> (see 
 <a href="somo_pdb_editor.html">here</a>).<br>
The PDB file can contain multiple models and if so, multiple models will be displayed by
<i>RasMol</i> and in the list box. In this case, you can select just a single model,
or multiple models by holding the crtl key while clicking on the models' names (crtl-A selects
all models). If multiple models are selected, all subsequent operations (except the SAXS/SANS options)
are carried out sequentially on the selected models. Pressing the <i><b>SAXS/SANS Functions</b></i> button will take you
to the SAXS/SANS module, where you can perform simulations on the selected PDB structure, or deal with experimental and/or previously generated data. Presently (November 2011), the SAXS/SANS module is in an advanced state but still under development. (see <a href="somo_saxs.html">here</a>). The <i><b>Hydrate</b></i> button will instead launch a new routine, presently under development, that will add explicit hydration water molecules to the selected structure, allowing a more reliable generation of SAXS/SANS simulated curves. This new functionality will be fully described <a href="somo_hydrate.html">here</a>. Pressing the <i><b>RUN DMD</b></i> button will first open the <a href="somo_cluster_dmd.html">set-up panel</a> for running a Discrete Molecular Dynamics (DMD) simulation on the selected structure. Once the parameters have been set, the DMD run can be launched through the <a href="somo_cluster.html"><b><i>Cluster</i></b> utility</a> of the <a href="somo_batch.html"><b><i>Batch Mode Operation</b></i> </a> module. <p>

<p>
<b>Bead Model Functions:</b><br>
Once one or multiple models are selected, the <i><b>Build SoMo Bead Model</b></i> and
<i><b>Build AtoB (Grid) Bead Model</b></i> buttons will also become active, the last two offering
alternative ways of generating a bead model.
In the <b>Bead Model suffix</b> field you can enter a tag that will be added to the bead model filename,
which is automatically generated from the PDB filename by adding "_1" and the extension ".bead_model".
In addition, if the <i>Add auto-generated suffix</i> checkbox is selected, the corresponding field above it is
populated with a series of alphanumeric characters specifying the main options chosen. These characters
will be also added to the bead model filename, to allow for a quick identification of the options used in its
generation. Thus, "A20" stands for a residues' ASA cutoff threshold of 20 A (default), "R50" stands for a bead's
ASA re-check cutoff threshold of 50% of its total surface area (default), "hi" signifies hierarchical overlap
reduction in all stages (alternatively, "sy" stands for synchronous overlap reduction), and "OT" means
that the outward translation option during overlap removal of exposed side-chain beads is active. The "-so" suffix
is added if the <i><b>Build SoMo Bead Model</b></i> button is then pressed, while the "-a2b" suffix is instead
added if the <i><b>Build AtoB (Grid) Bead Model</b></i> button is pressed. In this case, the suffix symbols
also include "G<i>n</i>" for the grid resolution, with <i>n</i> the actual value, and "hy" if the atomic-level
hydration option is active. Upon loading a PDB file and if the <i>Add auto-generated suffix</i> checkbox is selected,
the corresponding field will show the two current strings available for SoMo and AtoB bead models. If any of the 
options coded in the strings are changed, the field will be automatically updated. The final string will appear once
a bead model generation operation is launched.
Note that you can keep processing a loaded PDB file after changing any of the various model-building options
(see below). If the <i>Overwrite existing filenames</i> checkbox is selected, existing filenames will be
overwritten without a warning. Otherwise, a pop up menu will instead appear offering alternative options
(see <a href="somo_file.html">here</a>). The <i>Overwrite existing filenames</i>
checkbox is automatically selected for batch mode operations. A third button, <i><b>Grid Existing Bead Model</b></i>,
will operate the AtoB grid routine on a <i>previously generated</i> bead model. This button is not available
until a PDB file has been processed with either one of the two bead modeling primary options (see above), 
or until a previously-generated bead model file has been loaded (see below). If this operation is launched,
the "-a2bg" suffix is automatically added to the filename of the new bead model.<br>
Since model building can take some time, depending on the settings
and especially for large structures, selecting the <b>Automatic Calculate Hydrodynamics</b>
checkbox will allow the direct computation of the hydrodynamic parameters as soon as the model(s) 
generation has been completed. If this checkbox is not selected (<b>default</b> option), at the
end of the model building phase the progress bar will be at 100% and the bead model(s) can be
visualized with <i>RasMol</i> by clicking on <i><b>Visualize Bead Model</b></i> (recommended,
comparing the original structure with the bead model could reveal previously unforeseen problems).
The results of the accessible surface area (ASA) computations (see below) can also be visualized
in a pop-up window by clicking on the <i><b>View ASA Results</b></i> button; this file also includes the
computation of the radius of gyration (R<sub>g</sub>) directly from the atomic coordinates of the structure.
A just-generated or previously-generated bead model file can also be opened inside a text editor by pressing
the <b><i>View Bead Model File</b></i> button.<p>

Alternatively, you can load one or multiple previously-generated bead model by clicking
on either the <i><b>Batch Mode Operation</b></i> (see <a href="somo_batch.html">here</a>)
or the <i><b>Load Bead Model File</b></i> buttons from the menu. In these cases, and if the model(s)
was (were) generated/saved in the SOMO format, the various settings/parameters used in model generation will be displayed in
the right-side main window. Note that you can <i>decrease</i> the number of beads used, and thus the
resolution of the model, by applying a grid procedure on a previously-generated bead model with the
<i><b>Grid Existing Bead Model</b></i> option (see above). This could be useful when large structures are analyzed,
although using the improved AtoB routine on the original PDB file while increasing the grid size (<i><b>Build AtoB (Grid) Bead Model</b></i>) seems to produce much better results. By selecting different file types extensions, other type of bead models can also be loaded, like the old <i>BEAMS</i>-format models, or <i>DAMMIN/DAMMIF</i>-generated models. In this case, a <a href="somo_Dammin_Dammif_bead_model_properties.html">pop-up panel</a> appears requesting entering the partial specific volume and molecular weight of the model. The <i><b>SAXS/SANS Functions</b></i> button present in this subpanel will allow to perform SAXS-or SANS-related simulations directly on the currently loaded bead model. (see <a href="somo_saxs.html">here</a>). Finally, the <i><b>Rescale/Equalize Bead Model</b></i> function (currently not active) will allow an expansion of anhydrous bead models (like <i>DAMMIN/DAMMIF</i>-generated models) to account for an hydration layer.<p>

<b>Hydrodynamic Calculations:</b><br>
The hydrodynamic parameters can then be determined by clicking on <i><b>Calculate Hydrodynamics</b></i>.
A partial list of parameters can be seen in a pop-up window as soon as the calculations are completed by
clicking on <a href="somo_show_hydro.html"><i><b>Show Hydrodynamic Calculations</b></i></a>. The pop-up window

Such a list from a previously analyzed model can be opened also from the <i><b>Open Hydrodynamic Calculations File</b></i>
button. <br> The new <i><b>Select Parameters to be Saved</b></i> button will open a pop-up window 
(see <a href="somo_save.html">here</a>) where characterizing/computed parameters can be selected

checkbox will generate such file, with extension <i>.csv</i>. <p>

The black bar at the bottom of the progress window will instead report the detailed advancement of some of the
steps in the various phases, like the current slice and atoms (or beads) involved in the ASA routine,
and the iterations in the supermatrix inversion in the hydrodynamic computations. For small structures,
these numbers will be barely flashing by in the box, but for large structures they will allow a more in depth
monitoring of the various stages. <p>
Operations can be halted at any moment by clicking on the <i><b>Stop</b></i> button. To avoid inadvertendly
loosing data, the <i><b>Close</b></i> button will not immediately close SOMO, but confirmation will be required
in a pop-up window.

<td align=justify>
From this pull-down menu, you can call four different sub-menus controlling
the four tables containing the definitions of the atoms and residues found in
PDB files, and their SAXS coefficients.<br>
More in detail, you can define/edit the hybridizations, atoms and residues
that need to be interpreted as beads in the bead model generation.
These parameters are collected in different tables that are used 
as the components from which the bead sizes and positions are calculated.
PDB structures can then be converted to bead models based on the bead
parameters defined here. For SAXS simulations you also need the atomic
scattering factors coefficients (five exponentials plus a constant) and the
associated excluded volumes.
<ul>
<li>
<b>Add/Edit Hybridization:</b> Use this function to modify the <a href=
"somo-hybrid.png">hybridization table</a>. In this file you need to list all
hybridizations (as defined in Tsai et al., J. Mol. Biol. 290:253-266, 1999)
that will be used for the definitions of all atoms. Each hybridization
requires a name, a molecular weight (given by the sum of the mw of the 
atom being defined plus that of the hydrogen atoms bound to it) and a radius
(in Angstrom units). In addition, the neutron scattering length in H<sub>2</sub>O,
the number of exchangeable protons, and the total number of electrons are entered
in this module, because they are needed by the SAXS/SANS simulator module. Load the hybridization
file first if one exists, and then the SAXS Coefficients File. This is required because
the hybridization table contains also the atom identifiers linking each atom type to its X-ray
scattering coefficients. The use of this module is described in
<a href="somo_addhybridization.html">this help file</a>.

<li>
<b>Add/Edit Atom:</b> Use this function to modify the <a href=
"somo-2.png">atom table</a>. In this file the atomic groups present
in PDB files are defined, together with their parameters (molecular weight and
radius) loaded from the hybridization table. In addition, for SAXS simulation
this table is also linked to the SAXS coefficients table, and the excluded volume
for each atomic group can be defined in alternative to that of the bare non-hydrogen atom
taken from the SAXS coefficient table. The use of this module is described in
<a href="somo_addatom.html">this help file</a>.

<li>
<b>Add/Edit Residue:</b> Use this function to modify the <a href=
"somo-residue.png">residue table</a>. This module is used to define all residues
that can be found in PDB files. In this module, you can also define the rules
which are used to convert them into beads. You can add new residues or modify
the properties of the existing ones. The use of this module is described in
<a href="somo_residue.html">this help file</a>.
<li>
<b>Add/Edit Saxs Coefficients:</b> Use this function to modify the <a href=
"somo-saxs_coeff1.png">SAXS coefficients table</a>. In this module, you can add/edit
the atomic SAXS coefficients that will be used in the SAXS curve simulator. For each atom, the scattering
factor is approximate by a sum of four exponentials requiring eight coefficients and
a constant. The values in the somo.saxs_atoms are taken from the International Tables of
Crystallography, but can be edited at will. The use of this module is described in
<a href="somo_add_saxs.html">this help file</a>.<p>
