    <h2> Advanced Configuration Panel </h2>


    <p> <b>Note</b>: Some <b><i>UltraScan III</i></b> applications output debug
    text to STDOUT or a log file. Some only include certain GUI elements when
    in an advanced mode. Certain applications can benefit from use of more
    than one thread. These variations are governed by the configuration values
    that are set in this panel. Actual values should be set only under the
    guidance of software developers, since meanings of settings vary
    considerably from application to application.</p>

        <li>
            <b>Debug Level:</b> The quantity of debug outputs may be determined
            by the magnitude of the value selected here. The greater the count,
            the greater the number of debug lines output for applications that
            take advantage of the debug level value.
        </li>

        <li>
            <b>Advanced Level:</b> For certain applications, there are options
            that should only be visible and changeable by a highly knowledgeable
            user working in advanced mode. The level of advanced mode may be set
            with the counter here.
