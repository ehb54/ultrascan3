The parameters of this dialog define and control an analysis run to find the set of solutes that best fits experimental data. 
Each analysis run proceeds over a defined set of curves in s and f/f0 space. The single analysis pass produces the model whose associated simulation differs the least from the experimental data, as determined by its RMSD value. Time-invariant and/or radially-invariant noise(s) may also be computed. The curves in a set cover a specified s and f/f0 range and vary according to a specified increment or count. Each model has a specified number of input solute points along its curve. 

After an initial pass in which all the specified model curves are evaluated, the results are sorted by fitness (least RMSD). The best model then becomes the starting point for a second pass that utilizes Levenberg-Marquardt to refine the model. The result of that second pass is inserted as the final best model. 
For a straight line type, a specified variation count is given. Lines cover the full s range, with end points along the f/f0 range varying the specified number of times. Each implied starting point connects with each of the possible end points. So the square of the implied number of f/f0 end points is the number of models analyzed. If the type is Horizontal Line, the f/f0 value is the same for start and end points, so the number of models is the variations count itself (not its square). 

For sigmoid types, a variation count is directly specified. The curves cover the full s and f/f0 ranges, with "par1" and "par2" values each varying the specified number of times, yielding a number of test models equal to the square of that count. The par1 value changes logarithmically from 0.001 to 0.5; and par2 changes linearly from 0.0 to 1.0.

* **Define the Ranges:** Next, define the s and f/f0 ranges; and directly (sigmoids) or indirectly (lines) give the number of variations in each dimension. 

* **Specify Resolution Points:** Specify how many solute points exist on each curve. 

* **Set Threads:** Next, after control values are set, define a number of threads that is appropriate to the complexity of the run and the number of processors or cores available on your machine. 
* **Start the Fit:** Begin the fit analysis by clicking "Start Fit". 

* **Display and Save Results:** After simulation, a variety of options are available for displaying simulation results, residuals, and distributions. Report text files and graphics plot files can also be generated. 

* **Regularize:** If you wish to perform Tikhonov Regularization, you can set a Regularization Parameter (Alpha) or determine a good parameter value by clicking "Perform Regularization Scan". When you have a reasonable Alpha, click on Regularize Current Model.

    **Updated PCSA Fitting Controls**


Control dialog parameters differ slightly in interpretation, based on whether the curve type is a line or a sigmoid. 

* If straight line is specified, the curve variation count gives the number of start and end point f/f0 variations. 
* If horizontal line is specified, curve variations gives the total models, since start and end points always have the same f/f0 value.
* If one of the sigmoid types is specified, the specified number of variations is in both the par1 and par2 values of the sigmoid function:

.. note:: 

 Notes on Fit Stages and Regularization:

 * During all model fitting runs, at least two fit stages occur:
    * **Fixed Stage:** The models following fixed curves that were defined are evaluated and results ordered by best fitness (least RMSD).
    * **LM Stage:** The best model from the previous stage forms the starting point for a Levenberg-Marquardt fit sequence that results in a refined model being found. This refined model gets inserted at the top of the ordered models list.
 * If you wish to apply Tikhonov regularization in order to smooth concentration peaks in the final model, up to two additional stages may occur:
    * **Scan Stage:** Starting with the best model from the LM stage, a range of Regularization Parameter (Alpha) values is tested in a separate dialog to derive an optimal Alpha.
    * **Final Stage:** The result of the LM stage is used as a starting point for one final model computation, this time using a given Alpha.
 * Where regularization is to be employed, then, the two most common run sequences are:
    * **Fixed+LM+Scan+Final** -- where the optimal Alpha is unknown and needs to be determined, then applied.
    * **Fixed+LM+Final** -- where the optimal Alpha is already known or was determined in a previous sequence. This sequence may be employed after a ...Scan... sequence that used moderate Variations Count and Curve Resolution Points for speed. Those Count and Points values may now be increased for accuracy and this Fixed+LM+Final sequence performed.
 * Note that clicking the Start Scan button really initiates a Fixed+LM+Scan sequence. 
    * When it completes, clicking on the Final Fit button results in the Final stage being performed.
 * Note that where regularization is not to be employed (Alpha=0), the only run sequences that will be used is:
     * Fixed+LM -- where the final LM model is the desired overall final model.

  * - **Curve Type:**
    -  Select from the list of types; either a line or one of the sigmoid types.
  * - **Lower Limit (s x 1e-13):**
    -  Set a lower limit of sedimentation coefficient values to scan.
  * - **Upper Limit (s):**
    -  Set an upper limit of sedimentation coefficient values to scan.
  * - **Lower Limit (f/f0):**
    -  Set a lower limit of frictional ratio values to scan.
  * - **Upper Limit (f/f0):**
    -  Set an upper limit of frictional ratio values to scan.
  * - **Variations Count:**
    -  Specify the number of curve variations in each direction to form the models. Usually, the square of this value is the number of models to analyze. The number of variations is applied to each of "par1" and "par2" in the sigmoid computations. In the Horizontal Line case, this value is the number of models.
  * - **Grid Fit Iterations:**
    -  Specify the number of iterations of fixed grid fits to perform. Each iteration after the first starts with a range of par1 and par2 values or f/f0 values that is refined from the best models of the previous iteration.
  * - **Threshold Delta-RMSD Ratio:**
    -  Specify the ratio of the delta in RMSD to previous iteration RMSD that is the threshold below which the iterative scan is taken to have converged.
  * - **Curve Resolution Points:**
    -  Specify the number of points to generate for each test line. This is the number of solute points that each model will have.
  * - **Maximum L-M Evaluate Calls:**
    -  Specify the maximum number of Levenberg-Marquardt evaluate calls to allow. The default value of 100 is almost always sufficient for L-M to converge. This value is used to insure that a run-away condition will not occur. Additionally, a value of "0" may be specified to suppress L-M and use the final fixed grid best model as the overall best model.
  * - **Thread Count:**
    -  Specify by counter the number of threads to use for computations. This value is the total number of worker threads used at one time. The master thread generally has little work to do during computations, so the value may be set to your machine's total processors or cores, 8-16 threads work best for a typical single-wavelength datasets.
  * - **Start Fit**
    -  Click to begin the fit analysis. The analysis will proceed through fixed curve analysis followed by Levenberg-Marquardt refinement, resulting in either a final model or the base model from which regularization may proceed.
  * - **Stop Fit**  
    -  If something seems wrong with the progress of analysis or if you realize you have parameterized incorrectly, click this button to abort the fit run.
  * - **Perform Regularization Scan**
    -  Once fit analysis is complete, you may optionally click here to bring up a :ref:`Regularization Parameter Scan <regular_para>` dialog that sets the best value for Regularization Parameter.
  * - **Regularize Current Model**
    -  Any time you set the Regularization Parameter, either manually or through scan, you may then compute a final model, using that parameter, by clicking here. 


.. note:: Note that if the parameter is set to zero, the button here is relabeled to "Unregularize Current Model".

Regularization Parameter Scan
===============================

This dialog provides the means to perform a scan of possible regularization parameter (alpha) values. The final selected Alpha value - a number between 0.0 and 1.0 - is passed back to the Analysis Control dialog of PCSA. A full Parametrically Constrained pass can then be performed for the constant Alpha value.

The dialog begins with the final best model from an initial PCSA scan. The user chooses a range and increment of Alpha values and initiates a scan that computes models, each of which will have an associated variance and x-norm-squared value. The plot produced tracks a line through each of those points. The "elbow" of the curve is analytically determined and graphically represented. The Alpha of the elbow point may be accepted as is. Alternatively, the user may select a different point by holding down the Ctrl key and the left mouse button while positioning the resulting vertical line at the desired curve point. At mouse button release, the Alpha is displayed beneath the vertical line and in the Selected Alpha text box. Clicking the Accept button will close the dialog and communicate the Alpha in the text box to the calling PCSA Analysis Control dialog. 

.. note: Note that the text box Alpha may be manually changed to refine the accepted value.
