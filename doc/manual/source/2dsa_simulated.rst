2DSA Process:
================

*  **Step 1:** First, load experimental velocity data. Click on "Load Data" to select an edited velocity data set from the database or from local disk.
*  **Step 2:** Secondly, open an analysis control window by clicking on "Fit Control". Within that dialog, define the grids and iterations that comprise the analysis.
*  **Step 3:** Next, after having specified analysis parameters, begin the fit analysis by clicking "Start Fit".
*  **Step 4:** Display and Save Results: After simulation, a variety of options are available for displaying simulation results, residuals, and distributions. Report text files and graphics plot files can also be generated.


Fitting Analysis Process:
-------------------------------


*  **Step 1:** Define the Grids: First, define the overall solute grid with Fitting Controls giving an s and f/f0 range; and divide that total grid into subgrids using Grid Refinements.
*  **Step 1:** Set Refinement Iterations: Secondly, set a value for Maximum Iterations of refinement passes.
*  **Step 1:** Set any Meniscus/Monti Carlo: Thirdly, if desired, set parameters defining a Meniscus scan or set of Monte Carlo iterations.
*  **Step 1:** Set Threads: Next, after control values are set, define a number of threads that is appropriate to the complexity of the run and the number of processors or cores available on your machine.
*  **Step 1:** Start the Fit: Begin the fit analysis by clicking "Start Fit".
*  **Step 1:** Display and Save Results: After simulation, a variety of options are available for displaying simulation results, residuals, and distributions. Report text files and graphics plot files can also be generated.
