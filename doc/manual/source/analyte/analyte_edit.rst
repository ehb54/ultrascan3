**Panel Tab Options:**

* `Select Analyte <analyte_select.html>`_ - A panel whose primary purpose is to select an analyte to return to the caller.
* `Enter New Analyte <analyte_new.html>`_ - A panel whose primary purpose is to enter a brand new analyte, defined by specifying sequence for protein and nucleic components or manually enter the molecular weight (Da), Vbar and other required parameters of proteins, RNA, DNA, Carbohydrate/other analytes. 
* :ref:`Edit Existing Analyte <analyte_edit>` - A panel whose primary purpose is to add spectral characteristics of an already existing analyte.
* `Analyte Settings <analyte_settings.html>`_ - A panel whose primary purpose is to set Database-or-Disk input, the investigator; or to synchronize the local analyte components file from the database.

Edit Analyte Spectrum 
======================

The **Manage Spectrum** menu window allows the user to upload from local disk, upload and fit the spectrum using **Analyte Spectrum Fitter** window to determine the extinction coefficient at a wavelength range or add manually absorbance at specific wavelength.
