* `Edit Existing Analyte <analyte_edit.html>`_ - A panel whose primary purpose is to add spectral characteristics of an already existing analyte.

.. _select_analyte: 

The Select Analyte tab provides an interface for managing analytes used in sedimentation analysis. Users can select existing analytes, including proteins, DNA, RNA, and carbohydrates/other molecules, and view their details such as molecular weight, partial specific volume (vÌ„), and, for proteins, the extinction coefficient at 280 nm.

This tab also allows users to view spectral data or analyte properties and to delete analytes that are **not used** in any model.
