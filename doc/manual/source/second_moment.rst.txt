The second moment analysis will calculate weight-average sedimentation coefficients for each scan included in the analysis by finding the second moment point in the boundary. The second moment analysis can serve as a valuable diagnostics tool in identifying problems such as time-dependent degradation, aggregation and even concentration dependency.

.. note::
    It is important to keep in mind that the second moment analysis is only valid for scans that have cleared the meniscus and still have a stable plateau. All other scans should be excluded from the analysis.
