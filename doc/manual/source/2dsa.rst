This module enables you to perform 2-dimensional spectrum analysis on a chosen experimental data set. Upon completion of an analysis fit, plots available include: experiment; simulation; overlayed experiment and simulation; residuals; time-invariant noise; radially-invariant noise; 3-d model. Final outputs may include one or more models and noises.


The 2DSA method is used for composition analysis of sedimentation velocity experiments. It can generate sedimentation coefficient, diffusion coefficient, frictional coefficient, f/f :sub:`0` ratio, and molecular weight distributions. The distributions can be plotted as 3-dimensional plots (2 parameters from the above list against each other), with the third dimension representing the concentration of the solute found in the composition analysis. The set of all such final calculated solutes form a model which are used to generate a simulation via Lamm equations. The simulation is plotted overlaying a plot of experimental data.


Every 2DSA pass can be repeated for a specified number of refinement iterations. These iterations, in turn, can be repeated for a specified number of meniscus points or Monte Carlo iterations.


Each refinement iteration proceeds over a defined grid of s and f/f :sub:`0` values. That grid is divided into subgrids as defined by a number of grid refinements in each direction.

    **2-Dimensional Spectrum Analysis**


2DSA Process
================

*  **Step 1:** First, load experimental velocity data. Click on `Load Data <common_dialogs.html#data-loader>`_ to select an edited velocity data set from the database or from local disk.
*  **Step 2:** Secondly, open an analysis control window by clicking on `Fit Control <2dsa_analysd.html>`_. Within that dialog, define the grids and iterations that comprise the analysis.
*  **Step 3:** Next, after having specified analysis parameters, begin the fit analysis by clicking "Start Fit".
*  **Step 4:** Display and Save Results: After simulation, a variety of options are available for displaying simulation results, residuals, and distributions. Report text files and graphics plot files can also be generated.

Once an analysis is complete, the main window will appear similar to this:
