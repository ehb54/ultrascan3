This module is used to simulate binding isotherms for reversibly self-associating systems with up to three species (monomer, N-mer, M-mer). The program is started from the Simulation menu (Self-Association Equilibrium):

  * - **Association (1,2):**
    - Enter an integral value to specify the stoichiometry of the association (e.g., 2, 3, 4...) 
  * - **Equilibrium constants:**
    - Enter the natural log of the association constants for each reaction. 
  * - **Save Data to File:**
    - Export the currently displayed association profile to a csv file. 
  * - **Self-Association Profile for Simulation:**
    - Binding isotherms for Monomer, N-mer and M-mer. 
  * - **Species 1/2/3:**
    - Percentage of species' concentration with respect to the total concentration, requires mouse click on the canvas to be activated. 
  * - **Total Concentration:**
    - Total concentration of the reacting molecule. 
  * - **Help**
    - Display this and other documentation. 
  * - **Close**
    - Close all windows and exit.
