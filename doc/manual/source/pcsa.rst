This module enables you to perform parametrically constrained spectrum analysis on a chosen experimental data set. 
The PCSA method is used for **composition analysis** of sedimentation velocity experiments. It can generate *sedimentation coefficient*, *diffusion coefficient*, *frictional coefficient*, *f/f0 ratio*, and *molecular weight distributions*. The distributions can be plotted as `3-dimensional plots <3d_plot.html>`_ (2 parameters from the above list against each other), with the third dimension representing the concentration of the solute found in the composition analysis. The set of all such final calculated solutes form a model which is used to generate a simulation via Lamm equations. The simulation is plotted overlaying a plot of experimental data.

The PCSA pass proceeds for a set of models each of which consists of the solute points along a curve in s,f/f0 space. The model whose RMSD of the resulting residuals (simulation-experimental difference) is the lowest forms the starting point for a second phase which uses Levenberg-Marquardt to refine the model to a final output model. The set of initial curves is specified by a s and f/f0 ranges and a direct or implied number of variations in f/f0 end-points or sigmoid par1, par2 values. The type of curve used may be any of the following. 


 * **Straight Line**
 * **Increasing Sigmoid**
 * **Decreasing Sigmoid** 
 * **Horizontal Line [ C(s) ]**

PCSA Process: 
=================


 *  **Step 1:** *Load Experimental Data:* First, load experimental velocity data. Click on "Load Data" to select an edited velocity data set from the database or from local disk. 
 *  **Step 2:** *Define the Analysis Fit:* Secondly, open an `Analysis control window <pcsa_analys.html>`_ by clicking on "Fit Control". Within that dialog, define the ranges and counts that comprise the analysis. 
 *  **Step 3:** *Start the Fit:* Next, after having specified analysis parameters, begin the fit analysis by clicking "Start Fit". 
 *  **Step 4:** *Display and Save Results:* After simulation, a variety of options are available for displaying simulation results, residuals, and distributions. Report text files and graphics plot files can also be generated. 

Upon completion of an analysis fit, plots available include: model lines; experiment; simulation; overlayed experiment and simulation; residuals; time-invariant noise; radially-invariant noise; 3-d model. Final outputs may include a model and computed noises. A detailed explanation of the results are found in `Parametrically Constrained Spectrum Analysis Results <pcsa_results.html>`_

The main PCSA window is shown here in the state it appears after the completion of a fit run.
