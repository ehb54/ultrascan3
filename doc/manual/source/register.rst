The registration control panel allows UltraScan III registration or update of a license. The contact fields should be filled out completely and then the Update / Renew button clicked. 
If you are registering for the first time, you will be sent an e-mail with instructions for completing the registration process. If you are simply updating information, the process is complete after Update / Renew.
