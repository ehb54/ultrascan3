2-Dimensional Spectrum Analysis 
====================================

This module enables you to perform 2-dimensional spectrum analysis on a chosen experimental data set. Upon completion of an analysis fit, plots available include: experiment; simulation; overlayed experiment and simulation; residuals; time-invariant noise; radially-invariant noise; 3-d model. Final outputs may include one or more models and noises.

2DSA Overall Process
=====================

*  **Step 1:** First, load experimental velocity data. Click on `Load Data <../common_dialogs.html#data-loader>`_ to select an edited velocity data set from the database or from local disk.
*  **Step 2:** Secondly, open an analysis control window by clicking on `Fit Control <2dsa_analys.html>`_. Within that dialog, define the grids and iterations that comprise the analysis.
*  **Step 3:** Next, after having specified analysis parameters, begin the fit analysis by clicking "Start Fit".
*  **Step 4:** Display and Save Results: After simulation, a variety of options are available for displaying simulation results, residuals, and distributions. Report text files and graphics plot files can also be generated.
