    <h2> Managing Experiment Information </h2>

    <p class='center'><img src="images/convert-experiment.png" 
    alt="US_Experiment Window"/></p>

    <p>Using this window, you can manage experiment ( run ) information.</p>

    <p>The first step is to click on the &quot;Select Lab / Rotor /
    Calibration&quot; button and select the rotor calibration that was
    used in the experiment. The system knows which rotors and instruments
    are in which labs, so once the lab and rotor have been selected, 
    the selection boxes labeled Instrument and Operator will be populated.
    The rotor selection dialog is described in more detail 
    <a href='rotor.html'>Here</a>.
    </p>

    <p>The second step is to click on the &quot;Select Project&quot; button
    and select the project this experiment is associated with. The
    project selection dialog is described in more detail
    <a href='us_project.html'>Here</a>.
