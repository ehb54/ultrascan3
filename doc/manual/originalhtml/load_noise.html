    <h2> <i>UltraScan</i> Load Noise Vectors: </h2>

    <p> A number of <b><i>UltraScan III</i></b> applications load noise
    vectors for possible application to models. These applications use the
    US_NoiseLoader dialog class to allow the user to choose the vector(s).</p>

    <p> The dialog presented when a US_NoiseLoader is executed allows
    a choice of noise vectors from the database or from local disk.
    The source (database or disk) and the loaded model for which noise
    may be desired are part of the dialog creation. Noise choices are
    presented in a tree in which the top level consists of models that
    all share the same ancestor edit as the loaded model. Clicking
    on a noise description in the second level copies the selection to a
    lower list of selected noise vectors. Clicking on a top-level description
    line chooses all of its noise vector children.</p>

    <p> You may choose multiple noise records. Once selections are as desired,
    a "Load" button passes noise data to the caller. If there are
    multiple selected noise vectors of any one type - time-invariant ("ti") or
    radially-invariant ("ri") - the vectors are summed before being passed
    back to the caller. Details for all available noise vectors can be
    displayed.</p>

              entries can be expanded ("+") or contracted ("-") to reveal
              or hide noise vectors. Click on a desired noise to copy it to the
              select list below or click on a top-level entry to select all
