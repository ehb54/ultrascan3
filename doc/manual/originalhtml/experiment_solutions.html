    <h2> Create Experiment - Select Channel Solutions Panel: </h2>
    <p class='center'><img src="images/experiment_solutions.png"
    alt="Select Channel Solutions panel"/></p>

    <p> Using this panel, you can specify for each channel of each
    cell the solution to be used in the experiment. Existing solutions
    may be selected or a full dialog entered to define new solutions
    and any buffer, analyte contents of them.</p>

    <p> As with all panels, a set of tabs allows you to navigate to
    other panels in order to perform specialized subtasks relating
    to experiment creation. Links to and summaries of the panels are
    given in the final section of this page.</p>

    <h3> Dialog Items: </h3>

    <ul>
      <li><b>Solution</b> Pull down on a list and release on the
      solution to be used for the current cell/channel.</li>

      <li><b>Manage Solutions</b> Click this button to open a full
      solution dialog in which new solutions and analytes and
      buffers may be created. Acceptance of a solution in the dialog
      will change the contents of Solution lists in the Experiment
      Solutions panel.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3> Shared Dialog Items: </h3>

    <p>A panel status box and multiple buttons are shared by all panels.
    The <a href="experiment_general.html">General tab help page</a>
    has detailed explanations of these items.</p>

    <h3>Panel Tab Options:</h3>

    <p>In each panel, tabs are visible at the top of the window to enable the
    user to move to another panel, to perform specific experiment subtasks.

    <ul>
      <li><a href="experiment_general.html">1: General</a>
      A panel whose primary purpose is to specify the experiment run ID (a
      description string), select a parent project name, and possibly change
      data source (database or local disk) or database investigator name.
      </li>

      <li><a href="experiment_rotor.html">2: Lab/Rotor</a>
      A panel whose primary purpose is to select the Laboratory, Rotor, and
      Calibration values for the experiment.
      </li>

      <li><a href="experiment_speeds.html">3: Speeds</a>
      A panel whose primary primary purpose is to specify one or more speed steps.
      For each step, speeds and durations may be given.
      </li>

      <li><a href="experiment_cells.html">4: Cells</a>
      A panel whose primary purpose is to select the centerpieces (or
      counterbalance) for the cells, along with a quartz/sapphire windows
      selection.
      </li>

      <li><a href="experiment_solutions.html">5: Solutions</a>
      A panel whose primary purpose is to specify the solution to be used
      in each cell/channel.
      </li>

      <li><a href="experiment_photomult.html">6: Photo Multiplier</a>
      A panel whose primary purpose is to define extinction profiles and the
      implied photo multiplier voltage at each wavelength.
      </li>

      <li><a href="experiment_upload.html">7: Upload</a>
      A panel whose primary purpose is to engineer the creation of an
      experiment-defining JSON string and upload it to an Optima XLA
      database.
      </li>
    </ul>
