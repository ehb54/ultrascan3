    <h2> Database Configuration Panel </h2>


    <p> <b>Note</b>: Whenever <b><i>UltraScan</i></b> needs to use a database
    entry, it needs the user's master password.  The first time it is needed,
    it will prompt for it and save it in memory, but not on disk storage.  When
    needed again, <b><i>UltraScan</i></b> uses the stored password.  Before
    this can be done, the master password needs to be set up and a
    cryptographic hash of the password stored.  Use the <a
    href="master_pw.html">Master Password</a> panel, accessed form the main
    configuration panel, to set up or change the master password. </p>

    Configuration Panel'/> </p>

    <p> The database configuration panel allows you to configure the connection
    to the database that holds your experimental data. Here you can enter the
    name of the database, the username you use to connect to the database
    engine as well as your <em>database</em> login password, and finally the
    name of the host on which the database engine is running.
    <b><i>UltraScan</i></b> offers the option to configure multiple databases
    for facilities that may use multiple databases from different sites. The
    currently selected database is listed with the "(default)" tag. To change
    the default database, simply double-click on the desired database in the
    "Database List" section to select the database that needs to be set as
    default.  Now click on the <em>Save as Default</em> button.  The name in
    the database list with the "(default)" tag will then reflect the new
    default database. </p> 
    
    <p>When <em>Reset</em> is selected, the fields are cleared and a new entry
    can be entered. The <em>Test DB Connectivity</em> button will try to
    connect to the database in the Detailed Information fields to provide a
    confimation that the data is correct. </p>

    <p> To delete an entry, select it and click on <em>Delete Current
    Entry</em>. </p>
