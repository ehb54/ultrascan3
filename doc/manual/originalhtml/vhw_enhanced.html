<h2 id="introductions"> <i>UltraScan</i> van Holde - Weischet Enhanced Analysis: </h2>
    
<p> The method of van Holde and Weischet (vHW) is a versatile,
    model-independent approach to determine sedimentation coefficient
    distribution by graphically analyzing sedimentation velocity experimental
    data. The vHW method's strength derives from its ability to differentiate
    boundary spreading due to diffusion from boundary spreading due
    to heterogeneity in the sedimentation coefficient. This program uses a
    number of enhanced techniques for vHW analysis.</p>
