<h2> Rotor Stretch Calibration Utility: </h2>

<p class='center'> <img src="images/rotorstretch-0.png"> </p>

<p> The Rotor Stretch Calibration Utility can be invoked from the
Utilities:Rotor Calibration menu entry of the main screen.</p>
    
<p>The purpose of this program is to analyze rotor stretch profile data
acquired with the analytical ultracentrifuge, and to create a rotor
stretch calibration profile for different rotors in use at a laboratory.

<p>In combination with the centerpiece geometry, the rotor stretch
calibration serves to inform all analysis protocols relying on finite
element modeling about the position of the cell bottom, which is one of the
boundary conditions required for the solution of the Lamm equation. During
acceleration, the rotor will stretch and move the bottom of the celll
position by the amount of the stretch outward. The stretch is a function
of the rotor speed, which depends on the square of the angular velocity.
The rotor stretch calibration profile is stored in the LIMS database for each 
rotor in use and retrieved on the fly to calculate boundary conditions.
This value is calculated based on a second-order polynomial that describes 
the amount of stretch observed for each rotor.
</p>

<p>The amount by which each rotor stretches as a function of rotor speed
depends on the rotor's type and age. Hence it is advisable to individually
calibrate each rotor in use at a laboratory. The rotor stretch is mostly
independent of temperature and can be measured at any temperature. </p>

<p>The rotor stretch can be measured with either the Proteomelab XLA/XLI
instrument or the Optima AUC. The Optima is preferred, because it
offers higher radial resolution, and hence more reproducible data. The
recommended protocol is to acquire the calibration data by scanning the
7-channel calibration disk (available from AUC Solutions, 15826 Los Altos,
Houston, Texas 77083, USA Telephone: (210) 920-4AUC) which provides the
highest statistical significance by measuring displacement replicates from
13 edges.</p>

<p>The scanning protocol prescribes to spin up the rotor to 3,000 rpm
and to wait 15 minutes, then to scan the calibration disk five times in
intensity mode.  When scanning is complete, the rotor is accelerated by
1,000 rpm to 4,000 rpm, and, following another 15 minute equilibration period, the
calibration disk is scanned again five times in intensity mode. This cycle
is repeated until the maximum speed of the rotor has been reached.</p>

<p>The first step in the program is to load the calibration data from
a 7-channel calibration disk by clicking on the <em>"Load Calibration
Data"</em> button. Once the data are loaded, the user can select a
different cell, channel, or wavelength from this data set by manipulating
the respective counters or drop-down lists. The intensity data will be
shown graphically in the main window. The left half of the cell will
be drawn in red, the right half in green. <em>Make sure the checkbox
"Use 7-Slot Cal. Mask" is checked!</em>, and select the lowest speed
to be included in the fit. We recommend to set the slowest speed to
10,000 rpm, because the rotor stretch below 10 krpm is less than the
radial resolution of the instrument and therefore those measurements
are not useful.  In the status bar the message: "Please zoom all useful
vertical regions..." will appear:</p>

<p>In the next step, the user needs to zoom all vertical regions, marking 
the edge positions in the graph as shown by the green rectangle below:</p>

<p>Here it is recommended to exclude the left-most vertical region
since it typically is partially obliterated by the screwring of the cell
housing, as well as any noisy sections of the image, because they distort
the averaged data. After releasing the mouse, just the vertical regions
will be shown, and need to be separated by the lines draw in blue,
which can be created by clicking in the middle between each vertical
region. (Windows/Linux users: Hold control key while clicking, Mac users:
Hold command key):</p>

<p>Next, the user should click <em>Calculate</em> to process the 
data. The resulting fit will be shown on the next screen:</p>

<p>Absolute stretch values are plotted in blue as a function of speed,
with black crosses depicting the standard deviations of each stretch value,
and the blue line is a second-order polynomial fit that characterizes the stretch of 
the rotor as a function of rotor speed. At this point, the user can save 
the calibration profile by clicking on <em>Save Rotor Calibration</em>,
which will bring up a new dialog:</p>

<p>Clicking OK, the user is prompted with the <a href="rotor.html">
rotor management program</a> where a new stretch profile can be stored.

<p>It is important to note that the appropriate rotor is pre-selected,
based on the rotor information used to store the data originally in the
LIMS database when the data was committed to the database. The user can 
add a name for the calibration as well as a w<sup>2</sup>t value for the
rotor, if known. The date on which the rotor data are committed is 
automatically added to each rotor's profile in the LIMS system. The
final report can be printed out by clicking on <em>"View Calibration 
Report"</em>:</p>
