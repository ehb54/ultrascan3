    <h2> Create Experiment - General Definitions Panel: </h2>
    <p class='center'><img src="images/experiment_general.png"
    alt="Define General parameters panel"/></p>

    <p> Using this panel, you can define general experiment parameters,
    such as Run ID and Project, along with data source (database or
    local disk) and investigator. </p>

    <p> As with all panels, a set of tabs allows you to navigate to
    other panels in order to perform specialized subtasks relating
    to experiment creation. Links to and summaries of the panels are
    given in the final section of this page.</p>

    <h3> Dialog Items: </h3>

    <ul>
      <li><b>Run ID:</b> Enter a unique run identifier string that
      will identify the experiment to be run.</li>

      <li><b>Select Project</b> Click this button to open a full Project
      dialog in which a new project may be created or an existing one
      modified. Hitting the <b>Accept</b> button in that dialog will
      cause selection of a project for the experiment.</li>

      <li><b>(project list)</b> Pulling down and releasing on an item in
      the existing projects list causes the created experiment to be
      associated with that project.</li>

      <li><b>Select Investigator</b> Click this button to open a full
      database Investigator dialog in which an investigator may be
      chosen.</li>

      <li><b>(investigator text)</b> Any investigator chosen will be
      displayed in this text box. You may manually modify this text.</li>

      <li><b>Database</b> Select this radio button to indicate that
      data used in creating the experiment comes from the database.</li>

      <li><b>Local Disk</b> Select this radio button to indicate that
      data used in creating the experiment comes from the local disk.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3> Shared Dialog Items: </h3>

    <p>A panel status box and multiple buttons are shared by all panels.</p>

    <ul>
      <li><b>Status:</b> A text box shows the status of completion of
      needed parameterization for all the panels. Only when all panels
      have a 'X' state is upload of controls possible.</li> 

      <li><b>Help</b> Display the help manual page for the current panel.</li>

      <li><b>Status Update</b> Click this button to re-read elements of all panels
      to compose updated status summary text.</li>

      <li><b>Previous Panel</b> Convenience button to move to the panel
      previous to the current one.</li>

      <li><b>Next Panel</b> Convenience button to move to the panel
      that follows the current one.</li>

      <li><b>Close</b> Close the Experiment dialog. Note that any changes to
      database values or any upload of experiment controls is governed to
      elements within the panels of the Experiment dialog. This Close button
      merely closes the dialog, regardless of experiment definition state.</li>

    </ul>

    <h3>Panel Tab Options:</h3>

    <p>In each panel, tabs are visible at the top of the window to enable the
    user to move to another panel, to perform specific experiment subtasks.

    <ul>
      <li><a href="experiment_general.html">1: General</a>
      A panel whose primary purpose is to specify the experiment run ID (a
      description string), select a parent project name, and possibly change
      data source (database or local disk) or database investigator name.
      </li>

      <li><a href="experiment_rotor.html">2: Lab/Rotor</a>
      A panel whose primary purpose is to select the Laboratory, Rotor, and
      Calibration values for the experiment.
      </li>

      <li><a href="experiment_speeds.html">3: Speeds</a>
      A panel whose primary primary purpose is to specify one or more speed steps.
      For each step, speeds and durations may be given.
      </li>

      <li><a href="experiment_cells.html">4: Cells</a>
      A panel whose primary purpose is to select the centerpieces (or
      counterbalance) for the cells, along with a quartz/sapphire windows
      selection.
      </li>

      <li><a href="experiment_solutions.html">5: Solutions</a>
      A panel whose primary purpose is to specify the solution to be used
      in each cell/channel.
      </li>

      <li><a href="experiment_photomult.html">6: Photo Multiplier</a>
      A panel whose primary purpose is to define extinction profiles and the
      implied photo multiplier voltage at each wavelength.
      </li>

      <li><a href="experiment_upload.html">7: Upload</a>
      A panel whose primary purpose is to engineer the creation of an
      experiment-defining JSON string and upload it to an Optima XLA
      database.
      </li>
    </ul>
