   <h2> Determining Finite Element Model Statistics and Metrics </h2>
   <p class='center'><img src="images/us_modelmetrics-0.png" 
   alt="Model Metrics Window"/></p>

   <p>This program allows you to obtain statistics for a model computed
   by any finite element analysis module in UltraScan. The following
   metrics are supported:</p>

   <ul>
      <li>Three distribution limits D<sub>i</sub></li>
      <li>The span computed from the distribution limits</li>
      <li>The concentration integral between the lowest and highest distribution limit</li>
      <li>The minimum X-value of the distribution</li>
      <li>The maximum X-value of the distribution</li>
      <li>The mean, mode and median of the distribution</li>
      <li>The skew and kurtosis of the distribution</li>
   </ul>

   <p>The program is started by selecting a model from the database or
   disk. When using the database, the investigator needs to be specified,
   and a prefilter can be applied. Once a model has been loaded, the
   user can choose the distribution based on any of the hydrodynamic
   parameters available in the model by checking the radio button next to
   the parameter. By default, the sedimentation coefficient distribution
   will be shown. One of the parameters fitted will be fixed and not
   available for plotting.</p>

   <p>Once the model is loaded and the distribution parameter has been
   selected, default distributions limits D<sub>1</sub> - D<sub>3</sub>
   are set and the corresponding statistical values are calculated. At
   this point, the user can choose to add the current calculation and plot
   window to a report by clicking on <b><i>"Save to Report"</i></b>. The
   user can also change the smoothing level of the displayed distribution
   by changing the standard deviation (<b><i>"Sigma"</i></b>) value
   to non-zero, positive value. The distribution limits can also be
   adjusted to bracket different regions of the distribution and obtain
   different spans and centers. The adjustment of the top and bottom
   distribution limits can be used to integrate individual peaks in
   the distribution.</p>

   <p>The integral value between the top and bottom distribution
   limits should be close, but will not exactly match the selected
   difference. For example, a distribution limit of 10% and 90% will not
   provide exactly 80% difference. The reason for this is the discrete
   nature of the finite element model distributions, which contain
   discrete solute points. To obtain integral values closer to the
   selected percent difference the discrete nature of the distribution
   can be reduced to a more continuous distribution by increasing the
   sigma value</p>

   <p>For each model to be included in the report, <b><i>"Save to
   Report"</i></b> needs to be clicked once all parameters are set to
   acceptable values. Once all models have been evaluated, clicking on
   <b><i>"Show Report"</i></b> will call up the default browser on your
   system and display the cumulative report in html format. Clicking
   on the <b><i>"Reset"</i></b> button will reset all values to their
   original default values.</p>
