    <h2> Manage Buffer Information - Edit Existing Buffer Panel: </h2>
    <p class='center'><img src="images/buffer_edit.png"
    alt="Edit Existing Buffer panel"/></p>

    <p> Using this panel, you can change non-hydrodynamic
    characteristics of a buffer previously selected in the
    <a href="buffer_select.html">Select Buffer</a> panel.</p>

    <p> Once any desired modifications have been made, clicking on the
    <b> Accept</b> button will return you to the <b>Select Buffer</b>
    panel with a modified buffer.</p>

    <p> As with all panels, a set of tabs allows you to navigate to
    other panels in order to perform specialized subtasks relating
    to buffer management. Links to and summaries of the panels are
    given in the final section of this page.</p>

    <h3> Dialog Items: </h3>

    <ul>
      <li><b>Description</b> The description of the currently
      selected buffer for which modification are to be made.</li>

      <li><b>Cancel</b> Click this button to abandon any changes and
      return to the <b>Select Buffer</b> panel with the original
      unchanged buffer.</li>

      <li><b>Accept</b> Click this button to save any changes and
      return to the <b>Select Buffer</b> panel with a buffer as modified
      in this panel.</li>

      <li><b>pH:</b> Manually change pH to be associated with the current
      buffer.</li>

      <li><b>Manage Spectrum</b> This button brings up a
      <a href="us_buffer_spect.img.html">Manage Spectrum</a>
      dialog to set a Wavelength / Extinction profile for the buffer.</li>

      <li><b>Help</b> Show this documentation.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3> Important Note: </h3>

    <p>No other parameters than those indicated in this panel may be
    modified for an existing buffer. This is because existing buffers
    may be already associated with solutions and runs. Changing
    hydrodynamic characteristics already associated with models
    will invalidate those models.</p>

    <p>To create a buffer with most characteristics similar to an existing
    one, the users should note those characteristics; then name and enter
    a new buffer in the
    <a href="buffer_new.html">Enter New Buffer</a> panel, with selected
    parameters changed.</p>

    <h3>Panel Tab Options:</h3>

    <p>In each panel, tabs are visible at the top of the window to enable the
    user to move to another panel, to perform specific buffer subtasks.

    <ul>
      <li><a href="buffer_select.html">Select Buffer</a> A panel whose primary
      purpose is to select a buffer to return to the caller.</li>

      <li><a href="buffer_new.html">Enter New Buffer</a> A panel whose primary
      purpose is to enter a brand new buffer, defined mostly by specifying
      components and each one's concentration.</li>

      <li><a href="buffer_edit.html">Edit Existing Buffer</a> A panel whose
      primary purpose is to change non-hydrodynamic characteristics of an
      already existing buffer.</li>

      <li><a href="buffer_settings.html">Settings</a> A panel whose primary
      purpose is to set Database-or-Disk input, the investigator; or to
      synchronize the local buffer components file from the database.</li>
    </ul>
