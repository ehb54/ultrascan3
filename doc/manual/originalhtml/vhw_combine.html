    <h2> <i>UltraScan</i> van Holde - Weischet Combined Plots: </h2>

 <p class="center"><img src="images/vhw_combine.png" alt="vHW main Combine Window"/></p>

    <p> To combine integral van Holde - Weischet G(s) distributions from
    multiple datasets (either from different cells of the same run or from
    different runs), use "Combine Distribution Plots (vHW)" from the
    Utilities menu. This will allow you to compare integral distributions
    from different cells to each other. This may be useful if you analyzed
    the same sample under different conditions; for example, different pH
    levels or different concentrations. If the samples are the same, the
    distributions should overlay; if the samples behave differently, the
    distributions will be shifted relative to each other.</p>

    <p> All distributions will be plotted relative to the boundary fraction
    used in analysis. For example, if you analyzed 100% of the boundary,
    the distribution will range from 0 % to 100 % of the Y-axis.
    A distribution that was analyzed for 72 % of the boundary, shifted 8 %
    from the bottom will be plotted from 8 % to 80 % of the Y-axis. It is
    important that this distinction be made, since, for example,
    concentration-dependent samples will behave differently depending on the
    position in the boundary; or heterogeneous samples will show different
    distributions depending on which portion of the boundary was analyzed.</p>

    <p> When data are loaded, arrays of X,Y distribution and envelope values
    are read and saved. These are then used to quickly display plots.
    If you want to change the mix of data plotted, you may click the
    Reset Plot button; and then quickly make new selections that are
    plotted without need for recalculations.</p>

    <ul>
        <li>
            <b>Database</b> Check this radio button to indicate that
            distribution data to be selected is in the database.
        </li>
             
        <li>
            <b>Local Disk</b> Check this radio button to indicate that
            distribution data to be selected is on local disk file systems.
        </li>
             
        <li>
            <b>Load Data</b> Click on this button to open a
            <a href="vhw_combine-selrun.img.html">RunID Select Dialog</a>
            in which one or more run IDs may be selected from which
            distribution data files can be taken.
        </li>
            
        <li>
            <b>Save Data</b> Save combined integral distribution and
            envelope data to a local data file and, if input source so
            indicates, to the database.
        </li>

        <li>
            <b>Reset Data</b> Clear all data, lists and plots. To choose
            runs and triples, a new set of Load Data selections must be made.
        </li>

        <li>
            <b>Reset Plot</b> Clear all plots. Data is still saved, so
            a new set of plots can be created by simply selecting runs
            and triples.
        </li>

        <li>
            <b>Help</b> Display detailed vHW_Combine help.
        </li>

        <li>
            <b>Close</b> Close this application.
        </li>
            
        <li>
            <b>Integral</b> Check to specify that plots are to include
            integral distributions.
        </li>

        <li>
            <b>Envelope</b> Check to specify that plots are to include
            envelopes.
        </li>

        <li>
            <b>Current Run ID:</b> The read-only text to the right of this
            label indicates the currently selected run.
        </li>
            
        <li>
            <b>Save Plot under Project:</b> The name shown to the right of this
            label specifies the project subdirectory under which the combination
            is to be saved. By default, the name shown is the first run
            selected for plotting, but this can be changed by the user to any
            listed name. If "All" is selected, plot copies will be saved to all
            of the component run IDs.
        </li>
            
        <li>
            <b>Run IDs:</b> The list below shows all runs selected in
            Load Data dialogs. Click on a list line to reveal the Cell /
            Channel / Wavelength triples for the run.
        </li>

        <li>
            <b>Cell / Channel / Wavelength:</b> The list below shows the
            triples for the currently selected run. Click on a triple line
            to have its distribution/envelope added to the combined plot.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <p> Besides the integral distribution plots shown above, you may
    display envelope plots.</p>

    <p> You may also combine both integral and envelope plots in a single
    plot.</p>
