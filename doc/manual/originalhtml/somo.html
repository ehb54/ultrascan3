<h2><i>UltraScan</i> SOMO: </h2>

<p class="left"><img src="images/somo/somo_icon.png" alt="SOMO Icon"/></p>

<p>UltraScan Solution Modeler (US-SOMO) processes atomic and lower-resolution bead model representations of biological
    and other macromolecules to compute various hydrodynamic parameters, such as the sedimentation and diffusion
    coefficients, relaxation times and intrinsic viscosity, and small angle scattering curves, that contribute to our
    understanding of molecular structure in solution. Knowledge of biological macromolecules' structure aids researchers
    in understanding their function as a path to disease prevention and therapeutics for conditions such as cancer,
    thrombosis, Alzheimer's disease and others. US-SOMO provides a convergence of experimental, computational, and
    modeling techniques, in which detailed molecular structure and properties are determined from data obtained in a
    range of experimental techniques that, by themselves, give incomplete information.</p>

<p> SOMO help is available by starting US-SOMO either from the dedicated US-SOMO icon or from Simulation->Bead modeling,
    and then pressing the Help button on the SOMO window which will open a web browser to the relevant docs. </p>
