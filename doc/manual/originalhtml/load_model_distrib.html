    <h2> <i>UltraScan</i> Load Model Distributions: </h2>

    <p> A number of <b><i>UltraScan III</i></b> applications load model
    distribution data for processing. These applications use the
    US_ModelLoader dialog class to allow the user to choose the model(s).</p>

    <p> The dialog presented when a US_ModelLoader is executed allows a
    list of model choices from local disk or from the database. A Search
    button and text field allow the list to be pared down to those of
    interest. After a model or set of models is selected in the list, an
    Accept button passes model data to the caller. </p>

              <b>Database</b> Check this radio button to generate a
              list from the database.

            <li>
              <b>Local Disk</b> Check this radio button to generate a
              model list from local disk */ultrascan/data/models files.
            </li>

            <li>
              <b>Select Investigator</b> Click on this button to open an
              <a href="us_investigator.html">Investigator Dialog</a>
              that enables you to browse potential database investigators
              and select one. This button is diabled for normal unprivileged
              users and when Local Disk is selected.

            <li>
              <b>(investigator text)</b> This read-only text box displays the
              current investigator identifier number, last name, and first
              name.
            </li>
            
            <li>
              <b>Search</b> As characters are typed in the search text box,
              the list of models is pared down to those whose description
              matches the search field. Note that the search is
              case-insensitive. Enter a blank field to restore the full list.
              See detailed notes below on special search field text.

            <li>
              <b>(model list)</b> The list of model descriptions is generated
              either from local disk or db. Click on one or more entries to
              indicate your choice(s) of data to load. Click an entry with
              the right mouse button to get a <a href="load_model_dis-MID.html">
              Model Information Dialog</a> detailing model information. If
              models are selected, a right-mouse-button click displays
              information for all selected model entries. If there are no
              selections, the right-mouse-button click gives information for
              the row at which the cursor is positioned.

              <b>Cancel</b> Click to close the dialog with no choices made.
            </li>
            
            <li>
              <b>Accept</b> Click to accept the choice(s) highlighted in the
              model list and pass distribution data to the caller.

    <h3> Search Field Details: </h3>

    <p> Text you enter in the search field limits the models listed to those
    that match the implied criteria. In the simpliest and most common case,
    a string entered pares down the list to models whose description contains
    the given phrase without regard to case. For example, a search field of
    <b>"mc"</b> results in models with "mc", "MC", "Mc", or "mC" in their 
    descriptions.</p>

    <p> The search field <b>"=edit"</b> results in only models that derive
    from a specific edited data set. This facility applies in applications that
    preceed the model loader dialog with an edited velocity data set loader
    dialog.</p>

    <p> Another special field - <b>"=s"</b> - designates that Monte Carlo
    model sets normally presented as a composite model be separated out into
    each of the single models comprising the group. Use of this field should
    rarely be needed and be limited to advanced or developer users. If used,
    it may be combined with other fields. So, entries like "=s demo1",
    "demo1=s", "=edit=s" can be used to specify "single MC models" as well as
    a description filter on the list.</p>
