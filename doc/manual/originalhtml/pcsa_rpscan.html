    <h2><i>UltraScan</i> Regularization Parameter Scan and Plot for PCSA:</h2>

    <p> This dialog provides the means to perform a scan of possible
    regularization parameter (alpha) values. The final selected Alpha value
    - a number between 0.0 and 1.0 - is passed back to the Analysis Control
    dialog of PCSA. A full Parametrically Constrained pass can then be
    performed for the constant Alpha value.<p>

    <p> The dialog begins with the final best model from an initial PCSA
    scan. The user chooses a range and increment of Alpha values and
    initiates a scan that computes models, each of which will have an
    associated variance and x-norm-squared value. The plot produced tracks
    a line through each of those points. The "elbow" of the curve is
    analytically determined and graphically represented. The Alpha of the
    elbow point may be accepted as is. Alternatively, the user may select a
    different point by holding down the Ctrl key and the left mouse button
    while positioning the resulting vertical line at the desired curve point.
    At mouse button release, the Alpha is displayed beneath the vertical line
    and in the Selected Alpha text box. Clicking the Accept button will
    close the dialog and communicate the Alpha in the text box to the calling
    PCSA Analysis Control dialog. Note that the text box Alpha may be
    manually changed to refine the accepted value.</p>

    <h3> Sample Regularization Parameter Scan Dialogs:</h3>

    <p> The dialog images below show the plot results after a scan of Alpha
    values has completed. The yellow line connecting white dots tracks the
    variance, x-norm points associated with each Alpha. The red dashed lines
    are straight lines fitted to the first and last 5 points of the curve.
    The cyan line extends from the intersection of the two red lines to the
    point on the curve nearest to it. That nearest point is taken as the
    "elbow" of the curve; and its associated Alpha is the automatically
    determined best value. In the second image below, the user uses the
    Ctrl key and left mouse button to select an overriding elbow point
    and its associated Alpha value.</p>

    <h3> Functions:</h3>

    <ul>
       <li>
          <b>Model Type:</b> Documentation of the type of curve that defines
          models.
       </li>

       <li>
          <b>Points per Line:</b> Documentation of the number of solute points
          in input and scan models.
       </li>

       <li>
          <b>Best Model Par 1:</b> Documentation of the par1 value of the line
          that defines the input solutes of the model.
       </li>

       <li>
          <b>Best Model Par 2:</b> Documentation of the par2 value of the line
          that defines the input solutes of the model.
       </li>

       <li>
          <b>Starting Alpha:</b> A counter by which the user can set the
          starting Alpha of the scan to perform.
       </li>

       <li>
          <b>Ending Alpha:</b> A counter by which the user can set the
          ending Alpha of the scan to perform.
       </li>

       <li>
          <b>Alpha Increment:</b> A counter by which the user can set the
          increment between test Alphas in the scan to perform.
       </li>

       <li>
          <b>Selected Alpha:</b> A text box that is filled with the
          analytically determined Alpha or an Alpha associated with the
          curve point interactively set by the user using Ctrl-Left-Button
          mouse selection. This text box value can also be manually changed.
       </li>

       <li>
          <b>Start Scan</b> Click on this button once the scan Alpha range has
          been set, in order to begin a scan.
       </li>

       <li>
          <b>Help</b> Display this and other documentation.
       </li>

       <li>
          <b>Cancel</b> Close the dialog window and exit.
       </li>

       <li>
          <b>Accept</b> Close the dialog window, communicate the current
          Alpha value to the caller, and exit.
       </li>

    </ul>

    <p> Note that Model line point and variation values may be selected for
    speed in preparation for the Alpha scan. Once the Accept button is clicked
    here and focus is returned to the Analysis Control dialog, larger point
    and variation values may be used, along with the selected Alpha, in order
    to compute a more accurate final model.</p>
