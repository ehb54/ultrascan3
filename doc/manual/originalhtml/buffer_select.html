    <h2> Manage Buffer Information - Select Buffer: </h2>
    <p class='center'><img src="images/buffer_select.png"
    alt="Select Buffer panel"/></p>

    <p> Using this panel, you can select a buffer in the current
    database or on the local disk. Most commonly, you select a
    buffer in the provided list and click the <b>Accept</b> button
    to return it to the caller.</p>

    <p> As with all panels, a set of tabs allows you to navigate to
    other panels in order to perform specialized subtasks relating
    to buffer management. Links to and summaries of the panels are
    given in the final section of this page.</p>

    <h3>Panel Items:</h3>

    <ul>
      <li><b>(buffer list, left-side)</b> The items listed on the
      left side are all the descriptions (names) of buffers
      available or the descriptions as limited by the <b>Search</b>
      text. A single click on a list item selects a buffer.</li>

      <li><b>(component list, right-side)</b> The items listed on
      the right side are the components of the currently selected
      buffer, along with each one's concentration. This list is
      solely for information purposes.</li>

      <li><b>Search:</b> Enter a partial description to search for
      a specific buffer or set of buffers. Clear the text to expand
      to the full list.</li>

      <li><b>Density</b> The density of the currently selected
      buffer.</li>

      <li><b>Viscosity</b> The viscosity of the currently selected
      buffer.</li>

      <li><b>pH</b> The pH of the currently selected buffer.</li>

      <li><b>Compressibility</b> The compressibility of the currently
      selected buffer.</li>

      <li><b>Cancel</b> Close the buffer dialog and return to the
      caller with no change in buffer selection.</li>

      <li><b>Accept</b> Close the buffer dialog and return to the
      caller with the current buffer selection.</li>

      <li><b>View Spectrum</b> Open a
      <a href="us_buffer_spect.img.html">Manage Spectrum</a>
      dialog showing the Wavelength/Extinction profile associated
      with the currently selected buffer.

      <li><b>Delete Buffer</b> Permanently delete the currently
      selected buffer. A confirmation dialog will appear to allow
      you to cancel the delete request or to proceed with it.
      Upon confirmation, the removal will proceed regardless of any
      further action ("Cancel" or "Accept").</li>

      <li><b>Buffer Details</b> Open a
      <a href="buffer_info.img.html">Buffer Information</a>
      dialog showing detailed information about the currently selected
      buffer.</li>

      <li><b>Help</b> Show this documentation.</li>

    </ul>

    <h3>"Select Buffer" Panel Discussion:</h3>

    <p>As mentioned above, the most common use of this panel is to select
    a buffer in the provided list and click on the <b>Accept</b> button
    to return the selected buffer to the caller, such as a
    <a href="us_solution.html">Solution Management</a> dialog.</p>

    <p>The panel allows actions beyond simple buffer selection, including
    getting buffer information, deleting a buffer, or choosing the buffer
    for which non-hydrodynamic modifications are to be made. In summary,
    the most common actions for this panel are as follows.<p>
    <ul>
      <li>Select a buffer and <b>Accept</b> it for a caller.</li>
      <li>Select a buffer and modify its non-hydrodynamic characteristics
      by selecting the
      <a href="buffer_edit.html">Edit Existing Buffer</a> panel.</li>
      <li>Select a buffer to obtain information about it, including the
      details shown with the <b>Buffer Details</b> button.</li>
      <li>Select a buffer in order to remove it permanently from the
      database or local disk, with the <b>Delete Buffer</b> button.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Panel Tab Options:</h3>

    <p>In each panel, tabs are visible at the top of the window to enable the
    user to move to another panel, to perform specific buffer subtasks.

    <ul>
      <li><a href="buffer_select.html">Select Buffer</a> A panel whose primary
      purpose is to select a buffer to return to the caller.</li>

      <li><a href="buffer_new.html">Enter New Buffer</a> A panel whose primary
      purpose is to enter a brand new buffer, defined mostly by specifying
      components and each one's concentration.</li>

      <li><a href="buffer_edit.html">Edit Existing Buffer</a> A panel whose
      primary purpose is to change non-hydrodynamic characteristics of an
      already existing buffer.</li>

      <li><a href="buffer_settings.html">Settings</a> A panel whose primary
      purpose is to set Database-or-Disk input, the investigator; or to
      synchronize the local buffer components file from the database.</li>
    </ul>
