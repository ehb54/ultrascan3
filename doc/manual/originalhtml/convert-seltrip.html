    <h2> Select Triples for Delete </h2>

    <p>Using this dialog window, you can select triples to be deleted
    from the dataset. The final state of included and excluded
    triples determines what data will be output.</p>

    <p>The dialog consists of two list windows. The one on the left
    initially contains the included dataset triples at invocation.
    The right-side list is initially empty. Delete selection consists
    of clicking on one or more left-side-list triples and moving them
    to the "Excluded" list on the right, via the <b>Add  ===></b>
    button. You may remove triples from the excluded list by clicking
    on their entries in the "Excluded" list and moving them back to
    the "Included" list via the <b><===  Remove</b> button.</p>

    <p>Once the lists of included and excluded triples is as desired,
    the <b>Accept</b> button closes the dialog and communicates the
    selected triple deletions to the caller.</p>
