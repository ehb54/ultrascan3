    <h2> How to Manage Rotor Information </h2>

    <p> Using this window, you can manage rotor information on your local
    disk or in the current database.</p>

    <p>To load rotor information into the current window, first select
    the Use Database or the Use Local Disk radio button. Then select
    the appropriate lab in the lab drop-down box. Follow the sequence
    below that fits your particular situation. Note: most likely you
    will be using Sequence 1.</p>

    <h3>Sequence 1</h3>

    <p>In this sequence you have come to this window from US_Convert, 
    and you would like to select the rotor and rotor calibration 
    that were in place during your experiment. First, select the
    appropriate rotor from the top listbox, and then select the
    correct rotor calibration profile. The rotor calibration profiles
    are sorted in reverse order by date, so that the most recent
    one is on top. This is the most likely choice.</p>

    <p>Once the lab, rotor, and rotor calibration have been selected,
    you may click on the &quot;View Calibration Report&quot; button
    to view the report, or view other related information in the
    stretch coefficient boxes or the omega2t box. Click the
    &quot;Accept&quot; button to confirm your choices and return
    to the previous window.</p>

    <h3>Sequence 2</h3>

    <p>In this sequence you have come to this window from US_Rotor_Calibration,
    and you would like to associate the calibration with an existing
    rotor. Click on the rotor you would like to associate and then click
    on &quot;Save Calibration Data.&quot; Administrators only.</p>

    <p class='center'><img src="images/rotor-save-calibration.png" 
    alt="Save Rotor Calibration Window"/></p>

    <h3>Sequence 3</h3>

    <p>Click on &quot;Add Rotor&quot; to add a new rotor. Administrators
    only.</p>
