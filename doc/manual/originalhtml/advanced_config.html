    <h2 id="introduction"> Advanced Configuration Panel </h2>


    <p><b>Note</b>: Some <b><i>UltraScan III</i></b> applications output debug
    text to STDOUT or a log file. Some only include certain GUI elements when
    in an advanced mode. Certain applications can benefit from use of more
    than one thread. These variations are governed by the configuration values
    that are set in this panel. Actual values should be set only under the
    guidance of software developers, since meanings of settings vary
    considerably from application to application.</p>
