### Installation

The simplest way is to download and install a precompiled [binary](https://www.ultrascan3.aucsolutions.com/download.php)

### Building
 
If you wish to compile from source, here are some notes to get you started.

You will need [qt5](https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/gettingstarted.html) development and [qwt](https://qwt.sourceforge.io/) installed.

We typically compile from source as in [ansible roles build-qt, build-qwt & build-us3](https://github.com/KJSain/us3lims-roles/tree/master/roles)

One could also take hints from this [Dockerfile](https://github.com/ehb54/ultrascan3/blob/main/admin/codeql/docker/docker/Dockerfile) which uses an Ubuntu 20.04 container and qt packages.

Please create an issue or [contact us](https://www.ultrascan3.aucsolutions.com/contacts.php) if you have further questions.

### Container environment

Assuming you are experienced with containers...

A containerized development image is also available
```docker pull ehb1/us3comp```

The source is in `/ultrascan3`

Run and export the containers display in Linux 
```docker run -it --rm -e DISPLAY=${DISPLAY} -v /tmp/.X11-unix:/tmp/.X11-unix -v $HOME/.Xauthority:/home/xterm/.Xauthority --hostname $(hostname) ehb1/us3comp bash```

N.B. the `--rm` above will delete the container after you exit, so any changes will be lost after exiting.

Update the ultrascan3 code ```cd /ultrascan3 && git pull```

Compile both `us` and `us3_somo` ```cd /ultrascan3 && ./makeall.sh && ./makesomo.sh```

Run the compiled application ```LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/ultrascan3/lib:/qwt-6.1.5/lib /ultrascan3/bin/us```

Note - subprocesses do not currently run in the container, so you must run any compiled application individually, e.g. `us_fematch`
